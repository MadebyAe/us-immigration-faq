# Questions about employment authorization documents (EADs)

## What is an employment authorization document (EAD)?
An EAD is a wallet-sized card issued by USCIS that can be used as a List A document (evidence of both identity and US employment authorization) [1]. EADs issued since 2017 look like this:

![EAD specimen, 2017 edition](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/images/article-i9-central/USCIS_13.0-List-A-EAD-Current-Front_241x161%402x.png)

## Is the <q>USCIS#</q> on an EAD the same as the holder's Alien Number?
As of 2019, USCIS ominously states that *at this time*, the USCIS# on an EAD is just the holder's Alien Number, except that an Alien Number is written with a leading letter <q>A</q> and the USCIS Number is not [12]. The [USCIS Glossary](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary) has two separate entries for <q>Alien Number</q> and <q>USCIS Number</q>, which is an additional indication that at some point in the future, the two numbers may become different, but this hasn't occurred yet.

## How do I know whether I need an EAD?
According to USCIS, there are three different categories of aliens who are eligible for work authorization in the US [2]:

(a) Aliens whose status in the US authorizes them to work for any employer  
(b) Aliens whose status in the US authorizes them to work for a specific employer  
(c) Aliens whose status in the US makes them eligible to apply for employment authorization

An alien described in section (a) is automatically work-authorized simply by virtue of their status. This category includes lawful permanent residents, asylees, refugees, and aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) [3][44]. A lawful permanent resident is not issued an EAD, because the Green Card serves the equivalent purpose, but any other alien described in section (a) may apply for an employment authorization document to use as proof of their work authorization. Depending on the specific category, some aliens described in section (a) may also use alternative documents as proof of work authorization rather than an EAD (see for example [6]). If an alien described in section (a) chooses to be self-employed, then an EAD is not necessary; the EAD is evidence of employment authorization, but the employment authorization itself is an inherent aspect of their status.

Aliens described in section (b) include [H-1B](H-1B.md), [L-1](L-1.md), and [TN](TN.md) nonimmigrants. These aliens are sponsored by a particular employer and do not receive an EAD [4].

Aliens described in section (c) include international students, adjustment of status applicants, J-2 nonimmigrants, and some H-4 nonimmigrant spouses [5]. For example, a J-2 nonimmigrant may not begin working immediately upon their admission to the US, but rather, their J-2 status makes them eligible to apply for an EAD, and if the EAD is granted, then they are allowed to work in the US. Similarly, if an alien has a pending application for adjustment of status, this does not mean they are automatically work-authorized, but it means they can use their pending application to separately apply for work authorization.

## What does the category code mean on an EAD?
The category code, such as <q>C09</q> on the image shown above, refers to a particular paragraph of 8 CFR ยง274a.12: for example, if an alien requests an EAD based on 8 CFR ยง274a.12(c)(9), which means adjustment of status applicant, the alien's EAD will have the code <q>C09</q>.

There are some exceptions to this rule: for example, A17 means dependent spouse of E-1/E-2/E-3 worker, and A18 means dependent spouse of L-1 worker [13] (these classes of aliens are provided employment authorization by statute, not regulation). **If your category code is A17 or A18 then you are not employment authorized incident to status; that is, E and L dependent spouses are not allowed to work without having a valid EAD.** This is because the INA has the language <q>the Attorney General shall authorize the alien spouse to engage in employment in the United States</q> [22][23] indicating that the government must act affirmatively to grant employment authorization.

The codes <q>C09P</q> and <q>C16P</q> have the same meaning as <q>C09</q> and <q>C16</q>, respectively [16]. The letter <q>P</q> means that the EAD is a combo card that also serves as Advance Parole (see below) [14][15].

## If I have an EAD, can I work for any employer?
Aliens who are authorized employment incident to status (described in section (a)) are <q>authorized to be employed in the United States without restrictions as to location or type of employment</q> [3], so they can work for any employer unless otherwise prohibited by law (*e.g.,* some employers must hire US citizens only).

Aliens described in section (c) may be subject to restrictions on their employment, however most subcategories do not have any such restrictions.

For instance, USCIS declined to impose any restrictions as to the occupations that H-4 EAD holders may work in [24]. This is also true of other dependent categories: if an alien is described in section (b), and if their dependents are eligible for work authorization under section (c), then the dependents' work authorization does not have the same restrictions as the principal alien; they can work in any occupation. These dependent subcategories are: A17, A18, C01, C02, C04, C05, C07, C12, C26, and C34. However, a C12 spouse does have the same geographical restriction as the principal [5].

Some categories in section (c) are based on a pending application for a status that grants work authorization incident to status: for example, category C09 is based on a pending application for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident (category A01). This eligibility category was codified in 1981. The INS explained that this discretionary grant of employment authorization was based on the alien's pending application for a permanent status in the United States [30], and indicated that some classes of employment authorized aliens such as H-1 and L-1 (listed in 8 CFR ยง109.1(a)(6), which later became 8 CFR ยง274a.12(b)) may only engage in employment consistent with their status, while imposing no such restriction on applicants for adjustment of status or asylum [29]. Adjustment of status applicants thus became eligible for unrestricted employment authorization, which is still the case today [25]. Other subcategories in this group are C08, C09, C10, C16, C19, C20, C22, and C24.

Notably, however, the F-1 OPT EAD (C03A, C03B, or C03C) is restricted. The regulation states that "a student may apply to USCIS for authorization for temporary employment for optional practical training directly related to the student's major area of study." [28] USCIS and ICE have interpreted this to mean that the EAD, once granted, may only be used for employment related to the student's major [26][27]. For example, even if the F-1 nonimmigrant is maintaining employment related to their field of study at all times, they should not attempt to engage in unrelated side employment, such as driving for Uber or Lyft. ICE recommends that students maintain evidence that their employment is related to their degree. That being said, an OPT EAD holder is authorized for ordinary full-time employment, contract (*i.e.,* <q>1099</q> employment), and self-employment [27]. M-1 OPT EAD holders (category C06) are similarly restricted to employment in their field of study [5][26].

## How do I apply for an EAD?
Refugees and some asylees [6] will receive an EAD without having to make a separate application. An alien who qualifies for an EAD (see above) but does not receive one automatically must file Form I-765 with the required evidence stated in the form instructions [7].

## If I have a valid and unexpired EAD, does that mean I am in the US legally?
Not necessarily. For example, DACA beneficiaries qualify for EADs [5] but it is clear that they are not lawfully present in the US. However, in some cases, an EAD might be usable as evidence of legal status. For example, see [8].

There is one situation where the approval of an EAD application actually gives legal status: if an F-1 international student obtains a post-completion OPT EAD, they receive a period of status until 60 days after their employment authorization expires [9].

There is also one situation where the approval of an EAD application does not confer any status, but does protect the alien from unlawful presence, namely: when an alien holds a <q>compelling circumstances EAD</q> (category (c)(35) or (c)(36)). The EAD prevents the alien from accruing unlawful presence for as long as it remains valid. In addition, unlawful presence also does not accrue while the application for the compelling circumstances EAD is pending, provided that the application was timely filed and non-frivolous. [10][11]

In all other cases, when USCIS approves an EAD, they are *only* granting employment authorization to the applicant, and not any other immigration benefit.

## If my EAD expires, am I out of status?
As mentioned above, approval of an EAD does not confer status. It therefore stands to reason that, when an EAD expires, it does not cause the bearer to lose status, either.

This is particularly confusing for adjustment of status applicants, who sometimes assume that obtaining an EAD based on their pending I-485 gives them a temporary status that enables them to remain in status if their previous status expires or is otherwise lost. In actual fact, an alien who has properly filed a form I-485 is in a <q>period of authorized stay</q> while their form I-485 is pending [46], regardless of whether they have an EAD or not. If an alien's EAD expires while form I-485 is still pending, therefore, the alien remains in authorized stay, but may lose work authorization.

## Do I need to carry my EAD with me when I am in the US?
Unlike a green card, an EAD does not necessarily need to be carried by its holder at all times.

There are two separate issues here. First, there is INA 264(e) [17], which requires aliens in the United States to carry proof of alien registration. An EAD *may* be used for this purpose [18]; an alien would only be obligated to carry their EAD if they had no other registration document. This issue is also discussed in the [general FAQ](general.md).

However, another issue is that aliens may wish to carry with them proof that they have legal status or have complied with the immigration laws. While it is not legally required to carry such proof, it may help avoid unnecessary detention based on the suspicion that the alien is not lawfully present. Since an EAD will usually not constitute proof of authorized stay (see above), it is advised to carry the documents relating to the underlying basis of legal status or authorized stay. For example, if an alien has an expired I-94 but has timely filed an I-485, then a copy of the receipt notice should be carried since it is the pending I-485 that grants an authorized period of stay. Such an alien would have an authorized period of stay regardless of whether they had an EAD or not.

## What should I do if my EAD is lost or stolen?
Technically, losing the physical card does not revoke your employment authorization but some aliens will not be able to complete Form I-9 without having the card in hand and would therefore be barred from starting new employment. To continue employment with the same employer or engage in self-employment, it is not required to replace the physical card as long as you are still within the validity period for which employment was authorized by USCIS, or you fall into a category for which employment authorization does not expire.

If you do need to replace the physical card within its validity period (*e.g.,* to begin new employment) then you must file Form I-765 again and pay the required filing fee in order to replace the EAD [21]. Some categories of aliens are exempt from paying the fee for a *renewal* EAD, but a *replacement* of an EAD that is still within its validity period is different from a renewal. At the time of writing, the Form I-765 instructions state that a fee is always required for a replacement, except for adjustment of status applicants who paid the I-485 filing fee [21]. When filing for a replacement, be sure to carefully read the instructions that are in effect at the time of application.

## What should I do if my EAD has expired or is about to expire?
An expired EAD cannot be used as evidence of employment authorization for Form I-9. If you used your EAD to establish employment authorization when you completed Form I-9, then your employer is required to reverify your employment authorization when your EAD expires [32]. At that point, you must show that you have a new or renewed EAD with a future expiration date, or some other evidence of employment authorization, otherwise your employer must terminate your employment. However, if your EAD is eligible for automatic extensions, then reverification can be completed using the receipt notice for the renewal (we will discuss this below).

Aliens described in section (a) who are maintaining their status continue to be authorized for employment even if their EAD expires since they are employment authorized incident to status. Such aliens may be able to present some other proof of their employment authorization if they do not obtain a new or renewed EAD. They may also begin or continue any employment that does not require Form I-9, such as self-employment.

For aliens described in section (c), however, their employment authorization expires when the EAD expires [33]. Such aliens cannot begin or continue any employment after the EAD expires unless they have obtained a new or renewed EAD, are eligible for an automatic extension (see below), or have some other employment authorization.

Some types of EADs can be renewed. Form I-765 must be used to apply for a renewal EAD. Be sure to read the instructions [21] for details on whether your EAD can be renewed. The earliest date you can apply for a renewal is 180 days before your current EAD expires [31]. It is recommended that you apply as soon as possible since EAD processing times can be several months. If your EAD has already expired, you can still apply for a renewal, but you won't be eligible for an automatic extension.

If you are applying for a renewal of an EAD/AP combo card, the same time frame applies: the earliest date you can file is 180 days before the expiration of your current card [43].

## What is the automatic 180-day extension for EADs?
In some cases, applying to renew an EAD causes the original EAD's expiration date to be postponed by 180 days. In order for this automatic extension to occur, all of the following conditions must be met [35]:

1. The renewal I-765 application must have been filed while the original EAD is still unexpired. For example, if the last day of your EAD validity is April 27, 2020, then USCIS must receive the new I-765 on or before April 27, 2020. If there is any gap&mdash;for example, USCIS only receives the new I-765 on May 1, 2020&mdash;then the original EAD expires and the alien must wait for the new EAD to be approved.
2. The new EAD application must be for the same category as the original EAD; for example, if the original EAD had code A08 (Compact of Free Association) and the alien has filed an application for a C09 EAD (pending AOS) then the latter application would not cause the former EAD to be extended.
3. USCIS must have designated the EAD category as being eligible for automatic extensions.

At the time of writing, the categories that are eligible for automatic extensions are A03, A05, A07, A08, A10, A12, C08, C09, C10, C16, C19, C20, C22, C24, and C31 [16]. H-4 EAD and L-2 EAD holders, for example, are not on this list and thus cannot avail themselves of automatic extensions, while aliens with an EAD based on a pending AOS (category C09) may be eligible for an automatic extension.

Thus, an H-4 EAD or L-2 EAD holder should make an effort to submit a renewal I-765 as early as possible and hope the new EAD is approved before the old one expires; otherwise they will have a gap in their employment authorization. On the other hand, if an alien's C09 EAD reaches its printed expiration date when a renewal application is already pending, the original EAD, though expired on its face, is considered to be unexpired for the next 180 days. If the alien is completing Form I-9, they must present the original EAD together with the receipt notice for the renewal application in order to establish eligibility for employment [16][35]. An alien with a C09 EAD should still not procrastinate on filing for a renewal, just in case the renewal happens to take longer than 180 days to adjudicate (which is uncommon, but possible). If the renewal application is still pending 180 days after the original EAD's printed expiration date is reached, then the original EAD *actually* expires and cannot be used anymore.

If the renewal application is denied, then the automatic 180-day extension terminates [35]. In that case, an alien described in section (c) must stop working immediately even though their employer may not be notified about the denial. If the renewal application is approved, the alien should be reverified at some point before the end of the 180-day period.

There is one exception to rule 2 above: category codes A12 (Temporary Protected Status) and C19 (pending TPS), for the purposes of automatic EAD extensions, are considered as if they were the same code. A TPS EAD holder may also receive an automatic extension without having to apply for one, if such extension is announced in the Federal Register [16].

Note that in the case of an EAD/AP combo card, filing for a renewal does extend the employment authorization, but does not extend the parole authorization.

## Did USCIS announce any additional eligibility for EAD extensions due to the COVID-19 pandemic?
As of the time of writing (April 25, 2020), the answer is **no.** Although some news sources reported that USCIS announced automatic 240-day extensions of employment authorization, the [actual announcement by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/covid-19-delays-extensionchange-status-filings) **merely reiterates existing policy** regarding extensions of [H-1B status](H-1B.md#what-happens-if-my-employer-applies-to-extend-my-stay-but-my-i-94-expires-while-the-petition-is-pending) and other statuses that provide employment authorization as described in section (b). There is no special relief for aliens whose EADs are expiring or have expired.

## If I have an EAD, can my dependents receive an EAD?
If you have an EAD, your spouse and children will often, but not always, be able to obtain an EAD in the same category. It is important to remember that their qualification for an EAD usually is derived *from their own status*, and not *from your EAD*.

This distinction is often crucial in the case of C09 EADs. An alien qualifies for a C09 EAD if they have filed an I-485 and it is still pending. If a principal I-485 filer has obtained a C09 EAD, and they have a spouse or dependent children, those dependents usually can also file I-485s based on the principal's petition either concurrently with the principal or at a later time. This implies that:

* If a dependent has filed an I-485, then they would also be able to obtain a C09 EAD.
* If a dependent *cannot* file an I-485 (possibly because the dates have retrogressed since the principal filed) then they would not be able to get a C09 EAD. This is because C09 EAD eligibility is solely based on a pending I-485. One cannot apply for a C09 EAD on the basis that they are the dependent of a person who already has a C09 EAD.
* If the principal doesn't need their C09 EAD for some reason, and chooses not to apply for one, but the dependents have their own pending I-485s, the dependents can apply for EADs without the principal. (However, since there is no application fee for most C09 EADs, this is not typical.)

There is one exception to the general rule. This exception is for categories C35 and C36 (compelling circumstances with I-140) [35]:

* Dependents of C35 EAD holders can apply for C36 EADs.
* The dependent does not need to have a separate petition since the principal's I-140 petition will eventually be usable for adjustment of both the principal and dependents.
* Dependents cannot be granted C36 EADs until the principal has been granted their C35 EAD.

## If I use my EAD based on a pending Adjustment of Status, does it violate my nonimmigrant status?
Recall that most nonimmigrants may file to [extend their stay](general.md#can-i-extend-my-nonimmigrant-status-without-leaving-the-us) if they have been maintaining their status up until the point when the application to extend stay is filed. If a nonimmigrant has filed for [adjustment of status](green-card.md) then they usually will not be able to extend their stay any further since they will become subject to [INA 214(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1184#b). As a special exception, since L-1, L-2, and H-1B nonimmigrants, and the H-4 dependents of H-1B nonimmigrants, are exempt from INA 214(b), they can continue to extend their nonimmigrant status even after they have filed for adjustment of status [36][37][38] provided that all other requirements are met.

It is common for L-1, L-2, H-1B, and H-4 nonimmigrants to continue extending their stay while they wait for a final decision to be made on their adjustment of status application. In order to be eligible for extension of stay, they must still be maintaining their status at the time when the extension application is filed. For example, an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant who has been unemployed for over 60 days would no longer be maintaining status, and therefore could not obtain an extension. A question that is often asked is: if an H-1B, H-4, L-1, or L-2 nonimmigrant has a C09 EAD (pending adjustment of status), and they use that EAD to work, would they be failing to maintain their status?

We should be clear, first of all, that this question is about C09 EADs. Obviously, if an L-2 spouse uses an A18 EAD, then they would not be violating status, since the A18 EAD is specifically issued to L-2 spouses in order to allow them to work. Similarly, if an H-4 spouse uses a C26 EAD, that would not cause them to violate status.

It's also clear that if an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant uses their C09 EAD to *leave* their employer and begin work for a new employer, instead of having their new employer file an I-129 petition for them, then they would no longer be maintaining their nonimmigrant status [39]. If an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant violates their status, any H-4 or L-2 dependents of that nonimmigrant would also lose their nonimmigrant status as a consequence.

However, there has been some controversy over the following questions:

1. If an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant, while continuing to work at their primary job, uses a C09 EAD to take up side employment, would they be violating their status?
2. If an H-4 or L-2 nonimmigrant uses a C09 EAD to work, would they be violating their status?

Here, we wish to reiterate that nothing on this page constitutes legal advice. Furthermore, in the opinion of many lawyers, the answer to both questions above is <q>yes</q> (*i.e.*, you should not do these actions if you want to maintain your status). However, in the opinion of the authors of this page, the answer to both questions is <q>no</q> (*i.e.,* you can maintain status even if you do these actions).

Consider [8 CFR ยง214.1(e)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/214.1#e):

> A nonimmigrant in the United States in a class defined in section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Act as a temporary visitor for pleasure, or section 101(a)(15)(C) of the Act as an alien in transit through this country, may not engage in any employment. Any other nonimmigrant in the United States may not engage in any employment unless he has been accorded a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes employment or he has been granted permission to engage in employment in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. A nonimmigrant who is permitted to engage in employment may engage only in such employment as has been authorized. Any unauthorized employment by a nonimmigrant constitutes a failure to maintain status within the meaning of section 241(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Act.

Based on this paragraph, it is clear that an H-4 or L-2 nonimmigrant who works without authorization would be violating their status, since they do not have <q>a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes employment</q>, and they also have not been <q>granted permission to engage in employment</q>. However, an H-4 or L-2 nonimmigrant who is working using *any* valid EAD, including a C09 EAD, has been <q>been granted permission to engage in employment</q>. Therefore, this paragraph does not indicate that such a nonimmigrant would be violating their status. In addition, there are no known reports of an H-4 or L-2 nonimmigrant being denied an extension of their status on the basis of having used a C09 EAD for employment. There is at least one report of an H-4 nonimmigrant obtaining an extension of their status after having used a C09 EAD for employment [40]. Thus, in the opinion of the authors of this page, **an H-4 or L-2 nonimmigrant may use their C09 EAD without violating their status.**

Similarly, if an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant continues to work at their primary job (*i.e.,* the job that the petition for their nonimmigrant status is based on), and also takes up additional employment using their C09 EAD, then that nonimmigrant has <q>a nonimmigrant classification which authorizes</q> their primary employment, and has also been <q>granted permission to engage in employment</q>, allowing them to do their side job. None of the employment is unauthorized. Therefore, there is nothing in the paragraph that says that such an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant fails to maintain their status. One H-1B nonimmigrant has also reported being told by USCIS directly that they can maintain their status if they use the EAD for additional jobs, as long as they don't interfere with the primary job [41]. Thus, in the opinion of the authors of this page, **an H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant may use their C09 EAD without violating their status, as long as they meet all other requirements**&mdash;mainly, that they continue to do the job that their I-129 petition is based on, or change employers based on a new I-129.

The counterarguments seem to be without merit, as there is ultimately nothing in the law or the regulations that says that using the EAD is a failure to maintain status. The most nonsensical argument is the one that says that as soon as you use your EAD, you <q>switch</q> from your H/L status to <q>EAD status</q>. As we've explained on this page already, EAD is **not** a status. An EAD is simply evidence of employment authorization, which you may have either based on your status alone or because you applied for employment authorization from USCIS and it was granted to you.

It does appear, however, that USCIS may treat the compelling circumstances EAD (C35 and C36) differently. In some ways, USCIS seems to treat the compelling circumstances EAD as a pseudo-status (for example, C36 is like the <q>dependent status</q> of C35 as described in the previous section). The Federal Register article that announced the introduction of the compelling circumstances EAD [42] also mentions several times that nonimmigrants may lose their nonimmigrant status if they use a compelling circumstances EAD. There are also some indications, however, that USCIS may not have intended for this to be categorically true. In the opinion of the authors of this page, the issue of whether using a compelling circumstances EAD causes a status violation is currently unresolved.

## Can I apply for an initial or renewal EAD while I am outside the United States?
USCIS takes the position that an alien must be inside the United States in order to file Form I-765 [7][21][45]. It is not clear how strictly USCIS enforces this requirement, although the requirement to appear for biometrics for most EAD application types may serve as a (possibly unintentional) form of enforcement. It is generally not required to remain in the United States for the entire time while the I-765 is pending. However, one should be aware of the fact that departure from the United States may trigger the [abandonment of a pending change of nonimmigrant status](general.md#what-happens-if-i-travel-while-i-have-a-pending-application-to-change-my-nonimmigrant-status). If the EAD application is based on the status sought, it too must be denied. For example, if an alien in TD status files concurrently for a change of status to L-2 status, and an L-2 EAD, then leaves the US while the change of status is pending, the L-2 change of status will be denied. Since the L-2 change of status is denied, there is no basis to approve an L-2 EAD.

[43] You can get this information from <q>Ask Emma</q> on the USCIS website, by asking <q>When can I renew my combo card?</q>  
[44] In a [2003 memo](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=20015), USCIS clarified that the language <q>must apply to the Service for a
document evidencing such employment</q> and <q>as evidenced by an employment authorization document issued by the Service</q> do not mean that section (a) aliens need approval from USCIS in order to be employment-authorized. They receive employment authorization automatically when their status begins. However, some section (a) aliens cannot prove their employment authorization without an EAD, and so must apply to USCIS for an EAD before they can complete form I-9.
