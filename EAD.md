# Questions about employment authorization documents (EADs)

## What is an employment authorization document (EAD)?
An EAD is a wallet-sized card issued by USCIS that can be used as a List A document (evidence of both identity and US employment authorization) [1]. EADs issued since 2017 look like this:

## Is the <q>USCIS#</q> on an EAD the same as the holder's Alien Number?
As of 2019, USCIS ominously states that *at this time*, the USCIS# on an EAD is just the holder's Alien Number, except that an Alien Number is written with a leading letter <q>A</q> and the USCIS Number is not [12]. The [USCIS Glossary](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary) has two separate entries for <q>Alien Number</q> and <q>USCIS Number</q>, which is an additional indication that at some point in the future, the two numbers may become different, but this hasn't occurred yet.

## How do I know whether I need an EAD?
According to USCIS, there are three different categories of aliens who are eligible for work authorization in the US [2]:

(a) Aliens whose status in the US authorizes them to work for any employer  
(b) Aliens whose status in the US authorizes them to work for a specific employer  
(c) Aliens whose status in the US makes them eligible to apply for employment authorization

An alien in category (a) is automatically work-authorized simply by virtue of their status. This category includes lawful permanent residents, asylees, refugees, and aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) [3]. A lawful permanent resident is not issued an EAD, because the Green Card serves the equivalent purpose, but any other alien in category (a) may apply for an employment authorization document to use as proof of their work authorization. Depending on the subcategory, some aliens in category (a) may also use alternative documents as proof of work authorization rather than an EAD (see for example [6]). If an alien in category (a) chooses to be self-employed, then an EAD is not necessary; the EAD is evidence of employment authorization, but the employment authorization itself is an inherent aspect of their status.

Aliens in category (b) include [H-1B](H-1B.md), [L-1](L-1.md), and [TN](TN.md) nonimmigrants. These aliens are sponsored by a particular employer and do not receive an EAD [4].

Aliens in category (c) include international students, adjustment of status applicants, J-2 nonimmigrants, and some H-4 nonimmigrant spouses [5]. For example, a J-2 nonimmigrant may not begin working immediately upon their admission to the US, but rather, their J-2 status makes them eligible to apply for an EAD, and if the EAD is granted, then they are allowed to work in the US. Similarly, if an alien has a pending application for adjustment of status, this does not mean they are automatically work-authorized, but it means they can use their pending application to separately apply for work authorization.

## What does the category code mean on an EAD?
The category code, such as <q>C09</q> on the image shown above, refers to a particular section of 8 CFR §274a.12: for example, if an alien requests an EAD based on 8 CFR §274a.12(c)(9), which means adjustment of status applicant, the alien's EAD will have the code <q>C09</q>. There are some exceptions to this rule: for example, A17 means dependent spouse of E-1/E-2/E-3 worker, and A18 means dependent spouse of L-1 worker [13] (these classes of aliens are provided employment authorization by statute, not regulation).

The codes <q>C09P</q> and <q>C16P</q> have the same meaning as <q>C09</q> and <q>C16</q>, respectively [16]. The letter <q>P</q> means that the EAD is a combo card that also serves as Advance Parole (see below) [14][15].

## How do I apply for an EAD?
Refugees and some asylees [6] will receive an EAD without having to make a separate application. An alien who qualifies for an EAD (see above) but does not receive one automatically must file Form I-765 with the required evidence stated in the form instructions [7].

## If I have a valid and unexpired EAD, does that mean I am in the US legally?
Not necessarily. For example, DACA beneficiaries qualify for EADs [5] but it is clear that they are not lawfully present in the US. However, in some cases, an EAD might be usable as evidence of legal status. For example, see [8].

There is one situation where the approval of an EAD application actually gives legal status: if an F-1 international student obtains a post-completion OPT EAD, they receive a period of status until 60 days after their employment authorization expires [9].

There is also one situation where the approval of an EAD application does not confer any status, but does protect the alien from unlawful presence, namely: when an alien holds a <q>compelling circumstances EAD</q> (category (c)(35) or (c)(36)). The EAD prevents the alien from accruing unlawful presence for as long as it remains valid. In addition, unlawful presence also does not accrue while the application for the compelling circumstances EAD is pending, provided that the application was timely filed and non-frivolous. [10][11]

In all other cases, when USCIS approves an EAD, they are *only* granting employment authorization to the applicant, and not any other immigration benefit.

## Do I need to carry my EAD with me when I am in the US?
Unlike a green card, an EAD does not necessarily need to be carried by its holder at all times.

There are two separate issues here. First, there is INA 264(e) [17], which requires aliens in the United States to carry proof of alien registration. An EAD *may* be used for this purpose [18]; an alien would only be obligated to carry their EAD if they had no other registration document. This issue is also discussed in the [general FAQ](general.md).

However, another issue is that aliens may wish to carry with them proof that they have legal status or have complied with the immigration laws. While it is not legally required to carry such proof, it may help avoid unnecessary detention based on the suspicion that the alien is not lawfully present. Since an EAD will usually not constitute proof of authorized stay (see above), it is advised to carry the documents relating to the underlying basis of legal status or authorized stay. For example, if an alien has an expired I-94 but has timely filed an I-485, then a copy of the receipt notice should be carried since it is the pending I-485 that grants an authorized period of stay. Such an alien would have an authorized period of stay regardless of whether they had an EAD or not.

## What should I do if my EAD is lost or stolen?
Technically, losing the physical card does not revoke your employment authorization but some aliens will not be able to complete Form I-9 without having the card in hand and would therefore be barred from starting new employment. To continue employment with the same employer or engage in self-employment, it is not required to replace the physical card as long as you are still within the validity period for which employment was authorized by USCIS, or you fall into a category for which employment authorization does not expire.

If you do need to replace the physical card within its validity period (*e.g.,* to begin new employment) then you must file Form I-765 again and pay the required filing fee in order to replace the EAD [21]. Some categories of aliens are exempt from paying the fee for a *renewal* EAD, but a *replacement* of an EAD that is still within its validity period is different from a renewal. At the time of writing, the Form I-765 instructions state that a fee is always required for a replacement, except for adjustment of status applicants who paid the I-485 filing fee [21]. When filing for a replacement, be sure to carefully read the instructions that are in effect at the time of application.
