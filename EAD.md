# Questions about employment authorization documents (EADs)

## What is an employment authorization document (EAD)?
An EAD is a wallet-sized card issued by USCIS that can be used as a List A document (evidence of both identity and US employment authorization). EADs issued since 2017 look like this:

## How do I know whether I need an EAD?
According to USCIS, there are three different categories of aliens who are eligible for work authorization in the US [2]:

(a) Aliens whose status in the US authorizes them to work for any employer  
(b) Aliens whose status in the US authorizes them to work for a specific employer  
(c) Aliens whose status in the US makes them eligible to apply for employment authorization

An alien in category (a) is automatically work-authorized simply by virtue of their status. This category includes lawful permanent residents, asylees, refugees, and aliens with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) [3]. A lawful permanent resident is not issued an EAD, because the Green Card serves the equivalent purpose, but any other alien in category (a) may apply for an employment authorization document to use as proof of their work authorization. Depending on the subcategory, some aliens in category (a) may also use alternative documents as proof of work authorization rather than an EAD (see for example [6]). If an alien in category (a) chooses to be self-employed, then an EAD is not necessary; the EAD is evidence of employment authorization, but the employment authorization itself is an inherent aspect of their status.

Aliens in category (b) include [H-1B](H-1B.md), [L-1](L-1.md), and [TN](TN.md) nonimmigrants. These aliens are sponsored by a particular employer and do not receive an EAD [4].

Aliens in category (c) include international students, adjustment of status applicants, J-2 nonimmigrants, and some H-4 nonimmigrant spouses [5]. For example, a J-2 nonimmigrant may not begin working immediately upon their admission to the US, but rather, their J-2 status makes them eligible to apply for an EAD, and if the EAD is granted, then they are allowed to work in the US. Similarly, if an alien has a pending application for adjustment of status, this does not mean they are automatically work-authorized, but it means they can use their pending application to separately apply for work authorization.

## How do I apply for an EAD?
Refugees and some asylees [6] will receive an EAD without having to make a separate application. An alien who qualifies for an EAD (see above) but does not receive one automatically must file Form I-765 with the required evidence stated in the form instructions [7].

## If I have a valid and unexpired EAD, does that mean I am in the US legally?
Not necessarily. For example, DACA beneficiaries qualify for EADs [5] but it is clear that they are not lawfully present in the US. However, in some cases, an EAD might be usable as evidence of legal status. For example, see [8].

There is one situation where the approval of an EAD application actually gives legal status: if an F-1 international student obtains a post-completion OPT EAD, they receive a period of status until 60 days after their employment authorization expires [9].

There is also one situation where the approval of an EAD application does not confer any status, but does protect the alien from unlawful presence, namely: when an alien holds a <q>compelling circumstances EAD</q> (category (c)(35) or (c)(36)). The EAD prevents the alien from accruing unlawful presence for as long as it remains valid. In addition, unlawful presence also does not accrue while the application for the compelling circumstances EAD is pending, provided that the application was timely filed and non-frivolous. [10][11]

In all other cases, when USCIS approves an EAD, they are *only* granting employment authorization to the applicant, and not any other immigration benefit.
