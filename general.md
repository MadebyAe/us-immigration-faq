# General questions about the US immigration system
This section of the FAQ covers questions that apply broadly to foreigners regardless of their particular class of admission.

## What's the difference between "visa" and "status"?
A *visa* is issued to a foreign national by the State Department at a consular post outside the United States. It should be presented when seeking admission to the United States at a port of entry. Most foreign nationals must have a valid visa in order to enter the United States [1][2].

*Status* refers to the "category" that an alien who is present in the United States falls into. The word "status" in and of itself does not appear to be specifically defined anywhere in the law. Instead, the concept of "status" is referenced in various contexts in US immigration law:
* When an alien is admitted to the United States, they are classified as a lawful permanent resident [3] or within one of the lawful nonimmigrant classes described in [4] or under certain other provisions of the law. The alien therefore acquires a status as a consequence of their lawful admission. Nonimmigrants may or may not qualify for work authorization, depending on their status.
* Certain statuses are recognized by federal regulations as *lawful immigration status* [5]. A lawful nonimmigrant status expires at the end of the period of authorized stay [5]. Most aliens in lawful nonimmigrant status must comply with certain conditions in order to maintain that status [6][7][8].
* Failure to maintain lawful status may have consequences including removal from the United States [9], ineligibility for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident [10][11], ineligibility for extension of nonimmigrant status [12], ineligibility for change of nonimmigrant classification [13][14], and ineligibility for future admission to the United States [15]. The law recognizes certain exceptions to the above, which we won't get into in this answer.

## What happens when my visa expires?
An expired visa is not valid for admission to the United States [1][16] but under certain conditions, a visa may be considered to be automatically extended beyond its original expiration date. The validity period of a visa does not limit the period of authorized stay [16]. Thus, the expiration of a visa, in and of itself, does not mean a nonimmigrant is required to leave the United States, but if the alien does leave the United States, they must obtain a new visa from a consular post in order to re-enter the United States, unless they can benefit from the automatic revalidation provisions. A visa also does not constitute proof of alien registration [17].

## How do I know when my status expires?
Nonimmigrants who arrive in the United States by air or sea and are granted admission are issued an electronic I-94 form, which can be retrieved from [CBP's website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/). Those who arrive by land may be issued a paper I-94. In either case, the "admit until" date on the I-94 indicates the last day of the nonimmigrant's period of authorized stay [18]. If you are granted extension or change of status by USCIS, your approval notice will indicate the new period of authorized stay.

## Which statuses can I apply for in order to work in the US?
All lawful permanent residents are authorized to work in the US for as long as that status is not terminated [19]. Some nonimmigrants are eligible for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). EAD holders must be in possession of the physical card in order to satisfy I-9 requirements [20], and their employment authorization terminates when the card expires [21]. Finally, some nonimmigrant statuses authorize a foreign national to work only for their sponsoring employer(s). These are informally referred to as "work visas".

## Which nonimmigrant status should I apply for if I've found a company willing to sponsor me?
The most general nonimmigrant classifications an employer can sponsor you for if they seek to employ you on a full-time or part-time basis are H-1B, L-1, and O-1. Each of these has drawbacks, which is why obtaining work authorization in the US is considered difficult in general compared to other countries.
* [H-1B](H-1B.md), if you will be employed in a "specialty occupation" [22]. Most "engineering" roles qualify as specialty occupations because they require "theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge" and "attainment of a bachelorâ€™s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States." [23] The main disadvantage of the H-1B visa/status is that the quota is much lower than the number of people who want to apply.
* [L-1](L-1.md), for intracompany transferees who have worked outside the US for at least 1 year [24]. The main disadvantage of L-1 status is that it's impossible to change employers while in L-1 status.
* [O-1](O-1.md), for aliens of extraordinary ability. [25] The main disadvantage of the O-1 visa/status is that very few people can demonstrate that they are "extraordinary" enough to qualify.

There are also some treaties the United States with other countries that allow those countries' citizens to work for sponsoring employers in the US. Generally speaking, taking advantage of one of these statuses is a much easier way to obtain work authorization in the US than trying to apply for H-1B, L-1, or O-1 status.
* Canadian and Mexican professionals in certain professions set out in NAFTA are eligible for [TN](TN.md) status [26][27]. Note that Canadians do not need [visas](visas.md), but Mexicans do.
* Australians in specialty occupations are eligible for [E-3](E-3.md) visas/status. [28]
* Chileans and Singaporeans are eligible for a variant of H-1B status, known as [H-1B1](H-1B1.md), with a special quota that applies only to their respective countries [29][30]. They are therefore unaffected by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals applying for the limited number of H-1B visas.

If you're seeking to do an internship in the US, you don't need an H, L, or O visa. Instead, your employer will invite you to visit the US for an exchange program (often through a third-party organization such as [Cultural Vistas](https://culturalvistas.org/)), the purpose of which is for you to receive training at said employer. You will need to obtain [J-1](J-1.md) status, which is not numerically limited. Some J-1 interns will be subject to a 2-year home residency requirement following the completion of their visit.

## How can I get a green card through my employer, in order to live and work in the US permanently?
See the [green card FAQ](green-card.md).

## What is dual intent?
*Dual intent* occurs when an alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa or nonimmigrant status has two intents: an intent to live in the US temporarily for the purposes of their nonimmigrant classification, and an intent to live in the US permanently (also known as *immigrant intent*). This concept is significant because some nonimmigrant statuses *allow* dual intent, some explicitly *disallow* dual intent, and others exist in a grey area.

Among the statuses that explicitly *disallow* dual intent are B (visitor for business or pleasure), F (student), and J (exchange visitor). In order to be classified as a B, F, or J nonimmigrant, an alien must have "a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning" [31]. Furthermore, according to INA 214(b), the alien has the burden of proof and must affirmatively establish that they do in fact have a residence abroad they have no intention of abandoning, both when they apply for the B, F, or J visa, and when they are applying for admission [32]. In addition, the consular officer may be in possession of evidence that the B, F, or J visa applicant is likely to be an intending immigrant, such as: inconsistencies in the applicant's explanation of their proposed activities in the US, previous overstays, or an ongoing application for permanent immigration status. Consequently, 214(b) visa denials, in which the consular officer refuses to issue a B, F, or J visa on the grounds that the alien has failed to meet this burden of proof, are very common.

On the other hand, the H-1B, L, and V statuses have no requirement of a residence abroad [31], and are explicitly exempted from INA 214(b) [32]. They are considered to be statuses that explicitly *allow* dual intent, so that one cannot, for example, be denied an H-1B visa on the basis of an intention to immigrate. Similarly, as K nonimmigrants are expected to apply for adjustment of status to that of permanent resident, the K status also allows dual intent.

Applying for a green card while in a status that does not allow dual intent is considered risky. But contrary to popular belief, doing so is not illegal, does not constitute a status violation, and is not among the grounds for deportation or revocation of an approved nonimmigrant petition. Instead, the risk is that the applicant's attempt to *extend* their nonimmigrant status, or be re-admitted to the US as a nonimmigrant after a visit abroad, may be denied. The ongoing green card application can be regarded as evidence of immigrant intent, resulting in denial of nonimmigrant classification. For this reason, it's considered "safer" to apply for a green card while in a status that allows dual intent. However, there are exceptions to this rule, which we'll describe in other parts of the FAQ.

## As an immigrant, can I bring my family with me to the US?
If you are an employment-based immigrant, you most likely qualify to bring your spouse and unmarried children under 21 with you when you immigrate. The same is also true for some (but not all) other types of immigrants. See the answer [here](green-card.md#can-i-bring-my-family-with-me-when-i-immigrate-to-the-us) for the details. Derivative immigrants become lawful permanent residents in their own right; once they are granted lawful permanent resident status, maintaining that status depends on their own actions, not yours.

## As a nonimmigrant, can I bring my family with me to the US?
Some nonimmigrant classifications allow dependents. For example, an [H-1B](H-1B.md) worker's spouse and unmarried children under 21 would normally qualify for a status known as "H-4", although they also have the option of seeking admission or change of status to any other status that they may be qualified for. An [L-1](L-1.md) worker's spouse and unmarried children under 21 would normally qualify for L-2 status. There are some provisos: the dependents must not be inadmissible, and there are some rules for which children really count as "children" [33]. We won't get into these details here.

In general, each dependent needs their own passport and [visa](visas.md) in order to be admitted to the US: if you have an H-1B visa then your dependents must each apply for an H-4 visa if they want to be admitted in H-4 status. If you are visa-exempt (for example, because you're travelling on a Canadian passport) but your dependent is not visa-exempt, they still need a visa even though you don't. If you are not visa-exempt, but your dependent is, they still don't need a visa, even though you do.

If you are changing status based on an I-129 petition your employer is filing on your behalf (for example, to H-1B or L-1 status) then your dependents, if they are in the US, must file separately to the corresponding nonimmigrant status. The form used for this is Form I-539. On the other hand, if you are filing to change your own status, for example to F-1, then you and your dependents could be included on a single Form I-539 application to simultaneously change your status to F-1 and their status to F-2 [34][35].

## If I am a nonimmigrant, can my dependents study and work in the US?
TODO

## Is it possible to have derivative nonimmigrant status when the principal is absent from the US?
Where INA 101(a)(15) authorizes the admission of dependent nonimmigrants [36], it specifies that the dependents must be "accompanying or following to join". This means that when the principal is admitted, their dependents may either be admitted in the corresponding dependent status at the same time, or they can be admitted after the principal has already been admitted (not before).

TODO: Can dependents be admitted while the principal is temporarily absent?

TODO: Can dependents stay in the US if the principal leaves the US temporarily?

## If I am fired from my job or quit, what happens to my status?
If you are working in the US in E-1, E-2, [E-3](E-3.md), [H-1B](H-1B.md), [H-1B1](H-1B1.md), [L-1](L-1.md), [O-1](O-1.md), or [TN](TN.md) status and your employment ends, then you may be eligible for a 60-day grace period, which starts the day after the last day of your employment. You remain in status until either the grace period expires or your I-94 expires (**whichever is earlier**). [37] The grace period for F-1 OPT trainees is different; it will be discussed elsewhere.

During the grace period, since you are considered to still be *in status*, you remain eligible for extension of status or change of status [38]. For example:

* If you are in H-1B status and you enter the grace period, a new employer may file for extension of status during the grace period so you can be an H-1B employee for them. Due to [H-1B portability](H-1B.md#how-can-i-change-employers-in-h-1b-status), you can start working for the new employer as soon as the new petition is accepted for processing by USCIS.
* If you are in L-1 status and you enter the grace period, your options are more limited. But for the sake of demonstration, let's say you find a new employer that's willing to sponsor you for O-1 status. Then, they can file for a change of status during the grace period, but you cannot work until the petition is approved. (TODO: Discuss what happens if the grace period expires while the petition is pending.)

You can only get a grace period "once per authorized validity period". In practice this is not much of a restriction, because every time a petition by a new employer gets approved, you receive a new authorized validity period. For example, suppose:

* You are admitted in H-1B status on Oct 3, 2019 with status valid until Oct 13, 2022.
* You are fired on Jul 18, 2020.
* A new employer files an H-1B petition for you on Aug 25, 2020 and you start working for them on receipt.
* The new petition is approved with a validity period until Aug 25, 2023.
* On Jan 22, 2022, you are fired again.

In this situation, you would be eligible for a second grace period, since you were in an authorized validity period that began on Aug 25, 2020. The fact that this is within the original validity period from Oct 3, 2019 to Oct 3, 2022 is not relevant; the two periods overlap, but you used a grace period during the first one and now you are using a grace period within the second one.

On the other hand, suppose the situation were as follows:

* You are admitted in H-1B status on Oct 3, 2019 with status valid until Oct 13, 2022.
* You are fired on Jul 18, 2020.
* A new employer files an H-1B petition for you on Aug 25, 2020 and you start working for them on receipt.
* On Mar 12, 2021, the new H-1B petition is denied.

Upon the denial of the new petition, you would have to immediately stop working for the new employer. You already used your grace period for the authorized validity period starting on Oct 3, 2019, **and** although, during the period from Jul 19, 2020 to Mar 12, 2021, you were in an *authorized period of stay*, you did not receive a second *authorized validity period*, since an authorized validity period can only be established by the approval of a petition. Thus, in this case, you would not receive a second grace period. You would have to leave the United States immediately.

Note that the regulations state that "DHS may eliminate or shorten this 60-day period as a matter of discretion." [37] Thus, if you attempt to abuse the grace period provision, USCIS may simply decide to act as if the grace period has already expired. For example, if USCIS receives a petition to extend or change your status, and you are in a grace period, and USCIS decides that you should not receive that grace period, they will deny your petition and you will have to leave the US immediately.
