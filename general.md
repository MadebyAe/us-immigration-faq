# General questions about the US immigration system
This section of the FAQ covers questions that apply broadly to foreigners regardless of their particular class of admission.

## What's the difference between "visa" and "status"?
A *visa* is issued to a foreign national by the State Department at a consular post outside the United States. It should be presented when seeking admission to the United States at a port of entry. Most foreign nationals must have a valid visa in order to enter the United States [1][2].

*Status* refers to the "category" that an alien who is present in the United States falls into. The word "status" in and of itself does not appear to be specifically defined anywhere in the law. Instead, the concept of "status" is referenced in various contexts in US immigration law:
* When an alien is admitted to the United States, they are classified as a lawful permanent resident [3] or within one of the lawful nonimmigrant classes described in [4] or under certain other provisions of the law. The alien therefore acquires a status as a consequence of their lawful admission. Nonimmigrants may or may not qualify for work authorization, depending on their status.
* Certain statuses are recognized by federal regulations as *lawful immigration status* [5]. A lawful nonimmigrant status expires at the end of the period of authorized stay [5]. Most aliens in lawful nonimmigrant status must comply with certain conditions in order to maintain that status [6][7][8].
* Failure to maintain lawful status may have consequences including removal from the United States [9], ineligibility for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident [10][11], ineligibility for extension of nonimmigrant status [12], ineligibility for change of nonimmigrant classification [13][14], and ineligibility for future admission to the United States [15]. The law recognizes certain exceptions to the above, which we won't get into in this answer.

## What happens when my visa expires?
An expired visa is not valid for admission to the United States [1][16] but under certain conditions, a visa may be considered to be automatically extended beyond its original expiration date. The validity period of a visa does not limit the period of authorized stay [16]. Thus, the expiration of a visa, in and of itself, does not mean a nonimmigrant is required to leave the United States, but if the alien does leave the United States, they must obtain a new visa from a consular post in order to re-enter the United States, unless they can benefit from the automatic revalidation provisions. A visa also does not constitute proof of alien registration [17].

## How do I know when my status expires?
Nonimmigrants who arrive in the United States by air or sea and are granted admission are issued an electronic I-94 form, which can be retrieved from [CBP's website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/). Those who arrive by land may be issued a paper I-94. In either case, the "admit until" date on the I-94 indicates the last day of the nonimmigrant's period of authorized stay [18]. If you are granted extension or change of status by USCIS, your approval notice will indicate the new period of authorized stay.

## Which statuses can I apply for in order to work in the US?
All lawful permanent residents are authorized to work in the US for as long as that status is not terminated [19]. Some nonimmigrants are eligible for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). EAD holders must be in possession of the physical card in order to satisfy I-9 requirements [20], and their employment authorization terminates when the card expires [21]. Finally, some nonimmigrant statuses authorize a foreign national to work only for their sponsoring employer(s). These are informally referred to as "work visas".

## Which nonimmigrant status should I apply for if I've found a company willing to sponsor me?
The most general nonimmigrant classifications an employer can sponsor you for if they seek to employ you on a full-time or part-time basis are H-1B, L-1, and O-1. Each of these has drawbacks, which is why obtaining work authorization in the US is considered difficult in general compared to other countries.
* [H-1B](H-1B.md), if you will be employed in a "specialty occupation" [22]. Most "engineering" roles qualify as specialty occupations because they require "theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge" and "attainment of a bachelorâ€™s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States." [23] The main disadvantage of the H-1B visa/status is that the quota is much lower than the number of people who want to apply.
* [L-1](L-1.md), for intracompany transferees who have worked outside the US for at least 1 year [24]. The main disadvantage of L-1 status is that it's impossible to change employers while in L-1 status.
* [O-1](O-1.md), for aliens of extraordinary ability. [25] The main disadvantage of the O-1 visa/status is that very few people can demonstrate that they are "extraordinary" enough to qualify.

There are also some treaties the United States with other countries that allow those countries' citizens to work for sponsoring employers in the US. Generally speaking, taking advantage of one of these statuses is a much easier way to obtain work authorization in the US than trying to apply for H-1B, L-1, or O-1 status.
* Canadian and Mexican professionals in certain professions set out in NAFTA are eligible for [TN](TN.md) status [26][27]. Note that Canadians do not need [visas](visas.md), but Mexicans do.
* Australians in specialty occupations are eligible for [E-3](E-3.md) visas/status. [28]
* Chileans and Singaporeans are eligible for a variant of H-1B status, known as [H-1B1](H-1B1.md), with a special quota that applies only to their respective countries [29][30]. They are therefore unaffected by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals applying for the limited number of H-1B visas.

If you're seeking to do an internship in the US, you don't need an H, L, or O visa. Instead, your employer will invite you to visit the US for an exchange program (often through a third-party organization such as [Cultural Vistas](https://culturalvistas.org/)), the purpose of which is for you to receive training at said employer. You will need to obtain [J-1](J-1.md) status, which is not numerically limited. Some J-1 interns will be subject to a 2-year home residency requirement following the completion of their visit.

## Can I change my nonimmigrant status without leaving the US?
In most cases, yes. If you are in the US in one nonimmigrant status and you want a different nonimmigrant status, one method is to leave the US, apply for a new visa for the status you want to obtain, then re-enter the US. However, in most cases, it's also possible to apply for USCIS to change your status while you are still in the US, provided that your status is still valid at the time of filing [51].

If you want to change to E principal, H-1, H-2, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q-1, R-1, or TN status, then your employer must file Form I-129 with supporting evidence that you are entitled to that classification [47][49]. If you want to change to A, B, E dependent, F, G, H-4, I, J, L-2, M, O-3, P-4, R-2, T, TD, or U status, you must file Form I-539 with supporting evidence that you are entitled to that classification [34][48]. You cannot apply to change to C or K status [50].

A nonimmigrant with C, D, K, or S status, or who was admitted under the Visa Waiver Program, is not eligible for a change of status, unless changing to T or U status [52].

A J nonimmigrant who is subject to the home residency requirement, and who has neither fulfilled the requirement nor had it waived, is not eligible for a change of status, unless changing to A, G, T, or U status [51][52] and it appears that USCIS interprets this prohibition to include *former* J nonimmigrants as well [34]. For example, a former J exchange visitor who has not yet fulfilled the home residency requirement is allowed to leave and re-enter the US in B or F status, but could not use Form I-539 to switch from B to F status.

If a change of status is approved, USCIS will issue a Form I-797A whose tear-off portion contains a new I-94, indicating the alien's new nonimmigrant status and end date of that new status. [53][54] If the change of status is denied, the alien's status does not change.

## Can I extend my nonimmigrant status without leaving the US?
A nonimmigrant generally must leave the US on or before the expiration date of their I-94. It is often possible to use the same visa, or a new visa in the same category, to return to the US in the same status. However, in many cases, it's also possible to apply for USCIS to grant you an extension while you are still in the US, provided that your status is still valid at the time of filing [58].

If an alien has E principal, H-1, H-2, H-3, L-1, O-1, O-2, P-1, P-2, P-3, Q-1, R-1, or TN status, their employer must file Form I-129 in order to extend the alien's stay [49][55]. The employer must submit evidence that the alien will continue to perform the employment that qualifies them for their status.

If an alien has A, B, E dependent, G, H-4, K-3, K-4, L-2, M, O-3, P-4, R-2, T, TD, or U status, they must file Form I-539 in order to obtain an extension [34][56]. Form I-539 must be accompanied by evidence that the alien will continue to qualify for their status.

An alien admitted under the Visa Waiver Program, or an alien with C, D, K-1, or K-2 status, may not extend their stay [57]. Aliens from Visa Waiver Program countries who need to stay in the US for longer than the period allowed by the Visa Waiver Program should apply for B visas.

An international student with F status generally is admitted for *duration of status*; their I-94 does not show a specific end date. An alien who is maintaining F status and who must remain beyond the end date of their I-20 in order to complete their academic program must apply to their DSO for an extension, rather than submitting Form I-539. Upon approval, the DSO will issue a new I-20 [61]. An alien in F status who wishes to remain in the US to pursue post-completion optional practical training (OPT) must file Form I-765 [64]. If Form I-765 is approved, the alien may maintain F status without having to file Form I-539 [63]. Form I-539 must be used by students who failed to maintain F status and are applying for a discretionary reinstatement [34][62].

An exchange visitor with J status is usually admitted for duration of status [67], but if they wish to continue their program beyond the end date on their DS-2019, they must ask their sponsor to apply for an extension [65][66]. If the extension is approved, the alien will receive a new DS-2019 [66].

If an extension of status on Form I-129 or Form I-539 is approved, USCIS will issue a Form I-797A whose tear-off portion contains a new I-94, indicating the alien's new approved period of stay [59][60]. If the extension is denied, the alien's current I-94 is unaffected and they must still leave the US before its expiration date.

## How can I get a green card through my employer, in order to live and work in the US permanently?
See the [green card FAQ](green-card.md).

## What is dual intent?
*Dual intent* occurs when an alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa or nonimmigrant status has two intents: an intent to live in the US temporarily for the purposes of their nonimmigrant classification, and an intent to live in the US permanently (also known as *immigrant intent*). This concept is significant because some nonimmigrant statuses *allow* dual intent, some explicitly *disallow* dual intent, and others exist in a grey area.

Among the statuses that explicitly *disallow* dual intent are B (visitor for business or pleasure), F (student), and J (exchange visitor). In order to be classified as a B, F, or J nonimmigrant, an alien must have "a residence in a foreign country which he has no intention of abandoning" [31]. Furthermore, according to INA 214(b), the alien has the burden of proof and must affirmatively establish that they do in fact have a residence abroad they have no intention of abandoning, both when they apply for the B, F, or J visa, and when they are applying for admission [32]. In addition, the consular officer may be in possession of evidence that the B, F, or J visa applicant is likely to be an intending immigrant, such as: inconsistencies in the applicant's explanation of their proposed activities in the US, previous overstays, or an ongoing application for permanent immigration status. Consequently, 214(b) visa denials, in which the consular officer refuses to issue a B, F, or J visa on the grounds that the alien has failed to meet this burden of proof, are very common.

On the other hand, the H-1B, L, and V statuses have no requirement of a residence abroad [31], and are explicitly exempted from INA 214(b) [32]. They are considered to be statuses that explicitly *allow* dual intent, so that one cannot, for example, be denied an H-1B visa on the basis of an intention to immigrate. Similarly, as K nonimmigrants are expected to apply for adjustment of status to that of permanent resident, the K status also allows dual intent.

Applying for a green card while in a status that does not allow dual intent is considered risky. But contrary to popular belief, doing so is not illegal, does not constitute a status violation, and is not among the grounds for deportation or revocation of an approved nonimmigrant petition. Instead, the risk is that the applicant's attempt to *extend* their nonimmigrant status, or be re-admitted to the US as a nonimmigrant after a visit abroad, may be denied. The ongoing green card application can be regarded as evidence of immigrant intent, resulting in denial of nonimmigrant classification. For this reason, it's considered "safer" to apply for a green card while in a status that allows dual intent. However, there are exceptions to this rule, which we'll describe in other parts of the FAQ.

## As an immigrant, can I bring my family with me to the US?
If you are an employment-based immigrant, you most likely qualify to bring your spouse and unmarried children under 21 with you when you immigrate. The same is also true for some (but not all) other types of immigrants. See the answer [here](green-card.md#can-i-bring-my-family-with-me-when-i-immigrate-to-the-us) for the details. Derivative immigrants become lawful permanent residents in their own right; once they are granted lawful permanent resident status, maintaining that status depends on their own actions, not yours.

## As a nonimmigrant, can I bring my family with me to the US?
If your family members are not already US citizens or lawful permanent residents, then they may be eligible to receive a dependent status based on your nonimmigrant status. For example, an [H-1B](H-1B.md) worker's spouse and unmarried children under 21 would normally qualify for a status known as "H-4", although they also have the option of seeking admission or change of status to any other status that they may be qualified for. An [L-1](L-1.md) worker's spouse and unmarried children under 21 would normally qualify for L-2 status. There are some provisos: the dependents must not be inadmissible, and there are some rules for which children really count as "children" [33]. We won't get into these details here.

In general, each dependent needs their own passport and [visa](visas.md) in order to be admitted to the US: if you have an H-1B visa then your dependents must each apply for an H-4 visa if they want to be admitted in H-4 status. If you are visa-exempt (for example, because you're travelling on a Canadian passport) but your dependent is not visa-exempt, they still need a visa even though you don't. If you are not visa-exempt, but your dependent is, they still don't need a visa, even though you do.

If you are changing status based on an I-129 petition your employer is filing on your behalf (for example, to H-1B or L-1 status) then your dependents, if they are in the US, must file separately to the corresponding nonimmigrant status. The form used for this is Form I-539. On the other hand, if you are filing to change your own status, for example to F-1, then you and your dependents could be included on a single Form I-539 application to simultaneously change your status to F-1 and their status to F-2 [34][35].

If your family members do not qualify to accompany you to the US in a dependent nonimmigrant status, then they can apply for B-2 visas instead [45] or visit under the terms of the Visa Waiver Program. However, this does not provide a means for said family members to live in the US for long periods of time. For example, if you are an H-1B worker, your parents may be eligible for B-2 status to visit you in the US, but while you may spend 3 years working for your employer in the US, your parents are unlikely to be allowed to live in the US for 3 years in B-2 status.

## If I am a nonimmigrant, can my dependents work in the US?
Employment of aliens in the United States is heavily restricted by [INA 274a (8 USC Â§1324a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1324a) and [8 CFR Â§274](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/part-274a). In the case of nonimmigrant dependents, such as those in H-4 or L-2 status, employment is generally not permitted unless the individual has been issued an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by USCIS. The statutes and regulations do allow nonimmigrant dependents in some categories to receive EADs; see the FAQ section about the corresponding principal classifications for more information (for example [the H-1B FAQ](H-1b.md)).

## If I am a nonimmigrant, can my dependents study in the US?
Dependent nonimmigrant status is based on the relationship to the principal nonimmigrant, and not on any particular activity. Dependent nonimmigrants may therefore choose to undertake a variety of activities in the US without violating their status, including study. As there is no law prohibiting aliens from studying in the US generally, all nonimmigrant dependent classifications permit study. In fact, the Supreme Court has ruled that school-aged alien children are entitled to receive K-12 education on the same terms as US citizen children, even if they have not been lawfully admitted to the US [46].

However, note that (in contrast to nonimmigrants in dependent classification) B nonimmigrants, even if their primary purpose of travel is to be with a family member in the US, are specifically prohibited from studying [43][44].

## Is it possible to have derivative nonimmigrant status when the principal is absent from the US?
Where INA 101(a)(15) authorizes the admission of dependent nonimmigrants [36], it specifies that the dependents must be "accompanying or following to join". This means that when the principal is admitted, their dependents may either be admitted in the corresponding dependent status at the same time, or they can be admitted after the principal has already been admitted (not before).

TODO: Can dependents be admitted while the principal is temporarily absent?

TODO: Can dependents stay in the US if the principal leaves the US temporarily?

## If I am fired from my job or quit, what happens to my status?
If you are working in the US in E-1, E-2, [E-3](E-3.md), [H-1B](H-1B.md), [H-1B1](H-1B1.md), [L-1](L-1.md), [O-1](O-1.md), or [TN](TN.md) status and your employment ends, then you may be eligible for a 60-day grace period, which starts the day after the last day of your employment. You remain in status until either the grace period expires or your I-94 expires (**whichever is earlier**). [37] The grace period for F-1 OPT trainees is different; it will be discussed elsewhere.

During the grace period, since you are considered to still be *in status*, you remain eligible for extension of status or change of status [38]. For example:

* If you are in H-1B status and you enter the grace period, a new employer may file for extension of status during the grace period so you can be an H-1B employee for them. Due to [H-1B portability](H-1B.md#how-can-i-change-employers-in-h-1b-status), you can start working for the new employer as soon as the new petition is accepted for processing by USCIS.
* If you are in L-1 status and you enter the grace period, your options are more limited. But for the sake of demonstration, let's say you find a new employer that's willing to sponsor you for O-1 status. Then, they can file for a change of status during the grace period, but you cannot work until the petition is approved. (TODO: Discuss what happens if the grace period expires while the petition is pending.)

You can only get a grace period "once per authorized validity period". In practice this is not much of a restriction, because every time a petition by a new employer gets approved, you receive a new authorized validity period. For example, suppose:

* You are admitted in H-1B status on Oct 3, 2019 with status valid until Oct 13, 2022.
* You are fired on Jul 18, 2020.
* A new employer files an H-1B petition for you on Aug 25, 2020 and you start working for them on receipt.
* The new petition is approved with a validity period until Aug 25, 2023.
* On Jan 22, 2022, you are fired again.

In this situation, you would be eligible for a second grace period, since you were in an authorized validity period that began on Aug 25, 2020. The fact that this is within the original validity period from Oct 3, 2019 to Oct 3, 2022 is not relevant; the two periods overlap, but you used a grace period during the first one and now you are using a grace period within the second one.

On the other hand, suppose the situation were as follows:

* You are admitted in H-1B status on Oct 3, 2019 with status valid until Oct 13, 2022.
* You are fired on Jul 18, 2020.
* A new employer files an H-1B petition for you on Aug 25, 2020 and you start working for them on receipt.
* On Mar 12, 2021, the new H-1B petition is denied.

Upon the denial of the new petition, you would have to immediately stop working for the new employer. You already used your grace period for the authorized validity period starting on Oct 3, 2019, **and** although, during the period from Jul 19, 2020 to Mar 12, 2021, you were in an *authorized period of stay*, you did not receive a second *authorized validity period*, since an authorized validity period can only be established by the approval of a petition. Thus, in this case, you would not receive a second grace period. You would have to leave the United States immediately.

Note that the regulations state that "DHS may eliminate or shorten this 60-day period as a matter of discretion." [37] Thus, if you attempt to abuse the grace period provision, USCIS may simply decide to act as if the grace period has already expired. For example, if USCIS receives a petition to extend or change your status, and you are in a grace period, and USCIS decides that you should not receive that grace period, they will deny your petition and you will have to leave the US immediately.

## What happens if I travel while I have a pending application to change my nonimmigrant status?
In most cases where a change of status petition is filed on Form I-539 or Form I-129, if the petition is pending at the time when you leave the US, then USCIS will deny the change of status. See for example [41]. For example, this would apply if you are changing from F-1 to H-1B status (Form I-129) or from H-1B status to H-4 status (Form I-539), or from H-4 to L-2 status. Consequently USCIS will eventually render a denial on the petition.

Thus, if you absolutely must travel while a change of status petition is pending, then be prepared to apply for consular processing when you are abroad: that is, bring with you the appropriate documents in order to apply for a visa for your desired classification at a consular post. Once the visa is issued, you can return to the US in the new status.

In the case of I-129 change of status petitions, note that USCIS applies a two-step adjudication process (see [here](H-1B.md#what-is-the-process-to-apply-for-an-h-1b-visa-or-h-1b-status) for references) in which they first decide whether or not to authorize you to work for the sponsoring employer for a period of time, *then* decide whether or not to approve your status change. If you travel while this petition is pending, then the first step can still be approved on the merits, but the second step will be denied; you will receive an I-797B instead of an I-797A (see [42]). The I-797B must be used to apply for a visa.

## What happens if I travel while I have a pending application to extend my nonimmigrant status?
In most cases where an extension of stay is filed on Form I-539 or Form I-129, the petition will continue to be processed despite your departure from the US. See for example [41]. This includes, for example, extensions of H-4 or L-2 status, extensions of H-1B status with the same employer, and H-1B change of employer petitions. (When you change employers while retaining H-1B status, this is considered an "extension".) See [the H-1B page](H-1B.md#can-i-travel-while-an-h-1b-transfer-is-pending) for more information about travelling with a pending H-1B transfer.

Note that the "Last Action Rule" will apply to such cases [42]. According to this rule, the latest issued I-94 controls your status. For example, if your extension of stay petition is approved while you are outside the US, then USCIS will issue a new I-94, but when you subsequently return to the US, CBP will issue another I-94; the latter is later in time, so when it is issued, the former will be void. Or, alternatively, if you travel while your extension petition is pending, then return to the US while it is still pending, and the petition is eventually approved, the I-94 issued by USCIS will control, and will void the previous I-94 issued by CBP.

## Why is it that changes of status are abandoned but extensions of stay are not?
If you've read the preceding two sections, you might be asking this question. Because USCIS has not published a description of the official policy regarding travel with pending Form I-129 or I-539, we can only speculate.

You might be aware of the fact that, in most cases, the US government does not like it when aliens seek admission in one status with the actual intent of obtaining another status. For example, an alien should not attempt to enter the US with an existing B-2 visa if their plan is that immediately after entering the US, they will file to change to F-1 status. If the purpose of your trip is to study, then you are supposed to get an F-1 visa, and present the F-1 visa at the port of entry. This ensures that the State Department and CBP are appraised of the alien's intentions and are able to make the appropriate decision based on the evidence provided.

Given this fact, it is understandable that a change of status petition would be denied when the alien leaves the US. Suppose you are in F-1 status and you have filed to change to H-1B status. Then, if USCIS did not deny the pending petition upon your departure, it would mean that upon your return to the US, you would present the F-1 visa and be admitted in F-1 status with the knowledge that you would soon be changed to H-1B status based on your still-pending petition. This is contrary to policy objectives, so USCIS deals with it by ensuring that the petition will be denied. On the other hand, if it were an extension petition that did not change status, there would be no compelling policy objective necessitating the denial of the petition. Such denial would only result in additional workload for the government as the alien would need to go through consular processing or re-submit the extension petition.
