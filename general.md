# General questions about the US immigration system

## What's the difference between "visa" and "status"?
A *visa* is issued to a foreign national by the State Department at a consular post outside the United States. It should be presented when seeking admission to the United States at a port of entry. Most foreign nationals must have a valid visa in order to enter the United States [1][2].

*Status* refers to the "category" that an alien who is present in the United States falls into. The word "status" in and of itself does not appear to be specifically defined anywhere in the law. Instead, the concept of "status" is referenced in various contexts in US immigration law:
* When an alien is admitted to the United States, they are classified as a lawful permanent resident [3] or within one of the lawful nonimmigrant classes described in [4] or under certain other provisions of the law. The alien therefore acquires a status as a consequence of their lawful admission. Nonimmigrants may or may not qualify for work authorization, depending on their status.
* Certain statuses are recognized by federal regulations as *lawful immigration status* [5]. A lawful nonimmigrant status expires at the end of the period of authorized stay [5]. Most aliens in lawful nonimmigrant status must comply with certain conditions in order to maintain that status [6][7][8].
* Failure to maintain lawful status may have consequences including removal from the United States [9], ineligibility for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident [10][11], ineligibility for extension of nonimmigrant status [12], ineligibility for change of nonimmigrant classification [13][14], and ineligibility for future admission to the United States [15]. The law recognizes certain exceptions to the above, which we won't get into in this answer.

## What happens when my visa expires?
An expired visa is not valid for admission to the United States [1][16] but under certain conditions, a visa may be considered to be automatically extended beyond its original expiration date. The validity period of a visa does not limit the period of authorized stay [16]. Thus, the expiration of a visa, in and of itself, does not mean a nonimmigrant is required to leave the United States, but if the alien does leave the United States, they must obtain a new visa from a consular post in order to re-enter the United States, unless they can benefit from the automatic revalidation provisions. A visa also does not constitute proof of alien registration [17].

## How do I know when my status expires?
Nonimmigrants who arrive in the United States by air or sea and are granted admission are issued an electronic I-94 form, which can be retrieved from [CBP's website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/). Those who arrive by land may be issued a paper I-94. In either case, the "admit until" date on the I-94 indicates the last day of the nonimmigrant's period of authorized stay [18]. If you are granted extension or change of status by USCIS, your approval notice will indicate the new period of authorized stay.
