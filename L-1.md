## Why should I apply for L-1 as opposed to other work visas?
Most people who want to work in the United States will only be able to qualify for either [H-1B](H-1B.md) or L-1 status, although you can find a list of other work visas on the [general FAQ](general.md). There are a number of reasons why the H-1B visa may be regarded as more desirable, but it is also difficult to obtain because of the annual lottery. The low probability of winning the lottery discourages employers from sponsoring candidates for H-1B visas. The L-1 visa is a practical alternative as it has no annual quota and therefore no lottery.

The L-1 visa has different requirements from the H-1B visa. In particular, the alien does not need to prove that they have specialized knowledge about the field they work in; instead, to obtain an L-1B visa, it is only necessary that they have specialized knowledge about the operations of the company that is transferring them to the United States. Thus, even a person without a post-secondary degree can qualify for an L-1B visa, whereas qualifying for an H-1B visa would be much more challenging. To obtain an L-1A visa, the alien must be coming to the United States in a managerial capacity.

The spouse of an L-1 visa holder is eligible for unrestricted employment authorization [1]; this benefit is not extended to the spouses of [TN](TN.md), [O-1](O-1.md), or [H-1B1](H-1B1.md) workers. While spouses of H-1B workers may qualify for employment authorization, this benefit can take some time to obtain, and may be rescinded by the current administration.

The biggest disadvantage to L-1 status is that it does not provide any easy way to change employers while in the US. For this reason, many L-1 employees will seek to eventually transition to H-1B status. Besides that, Indian applicants for an [employment-based green card](EB.md) may eventually max out their allowable stay in L-1 status and must also switch to H-1B status in order to avoid disruption to their employment in the US. We will discuss these issues further below.

## Who qualifies for L-1 status?
An L-1 is a nonimmigrant alien who [23]:

> within 3 years preceding the time of his application for admission into the United States, has been employed continuously for one year by a firm or corporation or other legal entity or an affiliate or subsidiary thereof and who seeks to enter the United States temporarily in order to continue to render his services to the same employer or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof in a capacity that is managerial, executive, or involves specialized knowledge

There are therefore two criteria that must both be satisfied:

1. Within the 3 years before applying for L-1 status, the alien has worked outside the United States for at least one continuous year for some company and is now applying to work for the <q>same</q> company in the US (we won't get into the specifics of what this means).
2. The alien's employment in the US must be in a managerial or executive capacity, or involve <q>specialized knowledge</q>.

To be more specific:

* An alien is considered to have <q>specialized knowledge</q> if: <q>the alien has a special knowledge of the company product and its application in international markets or has an advanced level of knowledge of processes and procedures of the company.</q> [24] In other words, the specialized knowledge possessed by the alien must pertain specifically to the company; it is not sufficient to merely have specialized knowledge related to the alien's occupation [28].
* An employee may come to the US to open a new office provided that the necessary relationship exists between the US entity and the foreign entity [26].
* The qualifying year of employment must have been outside the US [25][26]. Thus, any time spent working for the same employer *in* the US does not count toward the one year requirement.
* Both the qualifying year of experience abroad, and the intended employment in the US, must be in a managerial, executive, or specialized knowledge capacity [26]. However, they don't have to be in the same capacity. For example, a specialized knowledge employee outside the US could be transferred to the US to be a manager or <i>vice versa</i>. [27]

L-1 status does not have restrictions as to the occupation of the employee, and may therefore be available to employees whose occupations do not qualify them for [H-1B status](H-1B.md). Many employees at multinational corporations could potentially qualify for a transfer to the US in L-1 status. However, if USCIS believes that a company is using the specialized knowledge category to transfer employees who are merely skilled workers and do not possess a significant level of specialized knowledge about the company, this can attract additional scrutiny of L-1 petitions.

## What is the process to apply for an L-1 visa or L-1 status?
L-1A and L-1B are petition-based classifications; an L-1 visa or change of status to L-1 cannot be granted unless the employer has filed an appropriate petition [2]. There are two types of L-1 petitions: individual petitions and blanket petitions. An individual petition is an application to classify a single alien beneficiary. A blanket petition is an application to USCIS to pre-approve the company to transfer employees to the US, including future employees whose identities and number are not yet known. Individual and blanket petitions are both filed on Form I-129 [3]. You don't have to worry about this form too much, since it will always be prepared by your employer or by a lawyer on your employer's behalf. However, we will make occasional references to it.

The two petitioning procedures will be discussed below. In both cases, keep in mind that the beneficiary will usually be required to apply for a [visa](visas.md) in order to apply for admission to the United States in L-1 status.

### Individual petition
The I-129 petition must be approved in order for an alien to receive a visa. It is not required to present a the physical approval notice  (I-797) to the consular officer [4] but many lawyers will recommend carrying a copy to the interview anyway.

The consular officer will annotate the visa with the name of the petitioner (employer), the petition receipt number, and the expiration date of the petition [5]. The CBP Inspector's Field Manual states that such an annotated visa is sufficient for admission [6], however many lawyers will recommend carrying a copy of the approval notice just to be safe.

If the beneficiary is visa-exempt, then they must present a copy of the approval notice at the port of entry in order to be admitted in L-1 status [6] (however, there are special rules for Canadian citizens, for which see below).

Due to the requirements of L-1 status, it is uncommon to apply for L-1 status while already in the United States; however, it is not impossible. An employer can request to change the status of an alien to L-1 at the time when it files the Form I-129 [7][10]. The adjudication of such a request is a two-step process, in which USCIS first determines whether the beneficiary qualifies for intracompany transferee classification, and then determines whether the beneficiary qualifies to change their status to L-1 while in the United States [8]. Usually, both steps will be approved, in which case USCIS sends Form I-797A, containing an I-94 indicating the new L-1 status and authorized period of stay [9]. However, it's possible that the petition is approved while the change of status is denied—typically because USCIS has determined that the beneficiary has violated their status, making them ineligible for a change of status—and the beneficiary must usually leave the United States and apply for a visa or for status at the port of entry.

### Blanket petition
When USCIS approves a blanket I-129 petition, the employer will receive an I-797 approval notice.

Form I-129S is used to request classification of a *particular* alien employee based on a blanket I-129 petition that has already been approved [11]. Form I-129S will be adjudicated by the consular officer at the time of visa application. In order for the employee to apply for the visa, the employer must complete Form I-129S and give the employee in question the original and two copies. The original and each copy of Form I-129S that are given to the employee must be attached to a copy of the approval notice of the blanket petition, and the employee must present the original and both copies to a consular officer to apply for an L-1 visa [12].

The consular officer may only approve the Form I-129S and grant the visa if they determine that the I-129S is <q>clearly approvable</q>, that is, the alien in question clearly qualifies for specialized knowledge, executive, or managerial classification with respect to the sponsoring employer [13]. If there is any doubt that the applicant qualifies, the consular officer will deny the application under INA 221(g). The employer then has the option of filing an individual L-1 petition for the employee under the procedure described in the previous section. [14]

When the consular officer approves Form I-129S, they will stamp the original and both copies, return the original and one copy to the applicant, and retain the second copy for their records [17]. At the port of entry, the employee must present the visa together with a copy of both the I-797 approval notice for the blanket petition, *and* the approved Form I-129S [15].

If the beneficiary is visa-exempt, form I-129S may be adjudicated by USCIS. The employer must file an original form I-129S with one copy, both of which have the I-797 approval notice for the blanket petition attached. If USCIS approves form I-129S, it will stamp both the original and the copy, returning the original to the employer and retaining the copy [16][18]. Again, the employee would have to present the I-797 and the stamped I-129S at the port of entry in order to be admitted. However, there are also special procedures for Canadian citizens, for which see below.

If the employee is already in the United States in some other nonimmigrant status and their employer wishes to change their status to L-1, the employer must submit Form I-129 and Form I-129S together to USCIS [19]. See the section on individual petitions for a discussion of the adjudication process for L-1 change of status petitions.

### Special procedures for Canadian citizens
Canadian citizens do not require L-1 visas. Consular officers therefore do not play a role in the adjudication of eligibility for L-1 status in the case of Canadian citizens (unless the Canadian citizen specifically decides to apply for a visa for some reason).

In individual L-1 cases, an original Form I-129 and one copy, together with supporting documentation and fees may be filed at the port of entry by the Canadian citizen seeking entry; the employer does not need to submit it to USCIS in advance of the employee's entry to the US [20]. If it is approved, the CBP officer will place an approval stamp, issue, an I-94, and forward the original I-129 to USCIS, which will eventually issue an I-797 approval notice [6].

An employer is not *required* to have the CBP officer adjudicate the individual L-1 petition for a Canadian employee. The employer may opt to file Form I-129 with USCIS in advance just as they would for a non-Canadian employee [22]. In this case, the I-797 approval notice could be used by the Canadian employee for admission to the US.

In blanket L-1 cases, the alien must present one original I-129S and two copies at the port of entry, together with the required fee and supporting documentation. The original and both copies must each have an attached I-797 approval notice for the blanket petition [21]. Again, the employer is not required to avail itself of this procedure; advance filing of Form I-129S also appears to be allowed [22]. However, the instructions for this are not clear.
