## Why should I apply for L-1 as opposed to other work visas?
Most people who want to work in the United States will only be able to qualify for either [H-1B](H-1B.md) or L-1 status, although you can find a list of other work visas on the [general FAQ](general.md). There are a number of reasons why the H-1B visa may be regarded as more desirable, but it is also difficult to obtain because of the annual lottery. The low probability of winning the lottery discourages employers from sponsoring candidates for H-1B visas. The L-1 visa is a practical alternative as it has no annual quota and therefore no lottery.

The L-1 visa has different requirements from the H-1B visa. In particular, the alien does not need to prove that they have specialized knowledge about the field they work in; instead, to obtain an L-1B visa, it is only necessary that they have specialized knowledge about the operations of the company that is transferring them to the United States. Thus, even a person without a post-secondary degree can qualify for an L-1B visa, whereas qualifying for an H-1B visa would be much more challenging. To obtain an L-1A visa, the alien must be coming to the United States in a managerial capacity.

The spouse of an L-1 visa holder is eligible for unrestricted employment authorization [1]; this benefit is not extended to the spouses of [TN](TN.md), [O-1](O-1.md), or [H-1B1](H-1B1.md) workers. While spouses of H-1B workers may qualify for employment authorization, this benefit can take some time to obtain, and may be rescinded by the current administration.

The biggest disadvantage to L-1 status is that it does not provide any easy way to change employers while in the US. For this reason, many L-1 employees will seek to eventually transition to H-1B status. Besides that, Indian applicants for an [employment-based green card](EB.md) may eventually max out their allowable stay in L-1 status and must also switch to H-1B status in order to avoid disruption to their employment in the US. We will discuss these issues further below.

## What is the process to apply for an L-1 visa or L-1 status?
L-1A and L-1B are petition-based classifications; an L-1 visa or change of status to L-1 cannot be granted unless the employer has filed an appropriate petition [2]. There are two types of L-1 petitions: individual petitions and blanket petitions. An individual petition is an application to classify a single alien beneficiary. A blanket petition is an application to USCIS to pre-approve the company to transfer employees to the US, including future employees whose identities and number are not yet known. Individual and blanket petitions are both filed on Form I-129 [3]. You don't have to worry about this form too much, since it will always be prepared by your employer or by a lawyer on your employer's behalf. However, we will make occasional references to it.

The two petitioning procedures will be discussed below. In both cases, keep in mind that the beneficiary will usually be required to apply for a [visa](visas.md) in order to apply for admission to the United States in L-1 status.

### Individual petition
The I-129 petition must be approved in order for an alien to receive a visa. It is not required to present a the physical approval notice  (I-797) to the consular officer [4] but many lawyers will recommend carrying a copy to the interview anyway.

The consular officer will annotate the visa with the name of the petitioner (employer), the petition receipt number, and the expiration date of the petition [5]. The CBP Inspector's Field Manual states that such an annotated visa is sufficient for admission [6], however many lawyers will recommend carrying a copy of the approval notice just to be safe.

If the beneficiary is visa-exempt, then they must present a copy of the approval notice at the port of entry in order to be admitted in L-1 status [6] (however, there are special rules for Canadian citizens, for which see below).

In the case of an alien who is already in the United States and is seeking to change to L-1 status without leaving the United States, the employer can make this request at the time when it files the Form I-129 [7][10]. The adjudication of such a request is a two-step process, in which USCIS first determines whether the beneficiary qualifies for intracompany transferee classification, and then determines whether the beneficiary qualifies to change their status to L-1 while in the United States [8]. Usually, both steps will be approved, in which case USCIS sends Form I-797A, containing an I-94 indicating the new L-1 status and authorized period of stay [9]. However, it's possible that the petition is approved while the change of status is denied—typically because USCIS has determined that the beneficiary has violated their status, making them ineligible for a change of status—and the beneficiary must usually leave the United States and apply for a visa or for status at the port of entry.
