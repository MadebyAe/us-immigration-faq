# Questions about visas
Before reading this section, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [difference between a visa and a status](general.md#whats-the-difference-between-visa-and-status).

## Which foreign nationals do not need a visa to enter the US?
While most foreign nationals must present a visa in order to enter the US, there are several exceptions, some of which are listed below:
* Returning lawful permanent residents should present their Permanent Resident Card (green card) or certain other documents [1].
* Nationals of certain countries may visit the US for business or pleasure using the [Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html). Note that "business" doesn't include "work". In addition, there are several restrictions on the VWP, including:
    * If arriving by air or sea, you will need to apply for advance authorization [2] through [ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/).
    * A foreign national who was admitted under the VWP and overstayed their visit becomes permanently ineligible for the VWP [3]. This means they will need a visa in the future unless they qualify for some other exemption.
    * Similarly, aliens previously removed from the US are permanently ineligible for the VWP [4].
    * Being refused a visa or admission to the United States makes it unlikely, but not impossible, to qualify under the VWP in the future. [5]
    * Foreign nationals admitted under the VWP are ineligible for extension of stay [6], change of nonimmigrant status [7], and adjustment of status unless as the immediate relative of a US citizen [8].
* Canadian and Bermudian citizens seeking admission as nonimmigrants using their Canadian or Bermudian passport are visa-exempt unless they are seeking admission in E, K, S, or V status [9]. The restrictions described above on the Visa Waiver Program do not apply to Canadians and Bermudians. However, Canadians and Bermudians cannot simply stroll into the US. If they want to be admitted in a status that requires additional documentation, such as F-1 or H-1B status, they must still present the required documentation at the port of entry.
* Mexican nationals seeking to visit the US for short periods of time can use their Border Crossing Card [10], but this is not really an exception since a Border Crossing Card can also be used as a B-1/B-2 visa.

## Can I renew a visa while in the US?
The expiration of your visa has no bearing on whether or not you may remain in the United States. However, nonimmigrants who aren't visa-exempt (see above) will need to present a visa the next time they leave and re-enter the US. Nonimmigrants who have made the US their home and who don't want to be stranded outside the US are often interested in knowing whether it's possible to renew their visa while they're still in the US, so that they can depart the US with a new visa already secured. Unfortunately, with very few exceptions, visas can only be issued outside the US at a consular post [12]. Even though federal regulations theoretically allow renewal of an E, H, I, L, O, or P visa while in the US, it doesn't seem that that option is currently available. Therefore, all H-1B, L-1, and other temporary workers in the US, other than those who are visa-exempt, should be prepared for the possibility that delays in obtaining a new visa will delay their return to the US after a trip abroad.

## Does a visa expire when the passport holding it expires?
No. A US visa remains valid until its indicated expiration date or until it is cancelled or revoked, even if the containing passport expires. The holder of the expired passport with the visa still in it can use that visa together with an unexpired passport bearing the same name. [13]

## Under which circumstances can an expired visa be used to enter the US?
Some nonimmigrants with expired visas can return to the US using the expired visa after a visit solely to foreign contiguous territory or adjacent islands for 30 days or less. It may be possible to take advantage of this provision even if the expired passport is for a different nonimmigrant classification than the one you hold at the time of departure and in which you intend to return. The regulations for so-called "automatic revalidation" are set out in [22 CFR §41.112(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/41.112#d) and [8 CFR 214.1(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/214.1#b). For a more readable overview, see [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date/auto-revalidate.html).

## Do I need a visa to attend a job interview in the US?
Attending a job interview is not "work", and is a permitted activity for visitors to the US. This means you don't need sponsorship from the company you're applying to merely to attend the job interview, and you may qualify for one of the visa exemptions listed above; for example, Canadians interviewing in the US only need their passport, while most Europeans will only need their passport and approved ESTA. Otherwise, a B-1 visa (or B-2 if the primary purpose of the trip is pleasure) is appropriate. However, you will have to leave and re-enter the US with an appropriate status (such as H-1B) in order to actually begin working. If the CBP officer believes that you're not going to comply with this rule, they will deny you entry.

## How can I apply for a nonimmigrant work visa?
This process involves both you and your sponsoring employer.
1. Your sponsoring employer must first file a petition with USCIS to establish your eligibility for one of the nonimmigrant classes eligible for employment in the US
2. Once this petition is approved, **you** can use it to apply for the corresponding visa type through [the usual procedure](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html); your employer does not need to be involved when you are applying for the visa itself.

If you're visa-exempt, you still need the approved petition from step 1 in order to obtain the nonimmigrant status you are seeking.

## Can I visit Canada with a US visa?
No. You need a Canadian visa, unless you're a citizen of one of the [visa-exempt countries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html).

## Can I visit Mexico with a US visa?
Yes. If you have a valid and unexpired US visa, then you don't need a Mexican visa to visit Mexico. [11]
