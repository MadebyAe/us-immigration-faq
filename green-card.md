## Is applying for a green card the only way to live in the US permanently?
Yes, with a few exceptions. Almost all nonimmigrant statuses are for a limited period of time and require "nonimmigrant intent", which means that DoS and CBP have discretion to stop granting you visas/status if they can see that you are trying to live in the US permanently. Some exceptions include:
* [O-1](O-1.md) status is exempt from the requirement to maintain a residence abroad [1], and can therefore be renewed indefinitely in 3-year increments. However, you must continue to work in the area of extraordinary ability for as long as you want to remain in O-1 status.
* American Indians born in Canada may live in the US permanently and are immune to deportation [2][3].
* Most citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau may live and work in the US indefinitely under the terms of the Compact of Free Association [4][5].

## Are there any reasons why I might not want a green card?
Yes. Lawful permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States confers both rights and responsibilities. Here are some reasons why you might not want to become an LPR: 
* Permanent residents, if male and between the ages of 18 and 26, are required to register for the Selective Service [6].
* An LPR is subject to taxation as a resident alien even if they reside outside the US for most of the year [7].
* You must actually reside in the US in order to maintain the rights associated with LPR status. If you abandon your residence in the US, you will need to file Form I-407 to renounce that status before you can be readmitted to the US as a nonimmigrant. If you have been an LPR for 8 or more years at the time when you give up that status, you may be subject to an expatriation tax [8].

## How can I apply for lawful permanent residence (green card status)?
You can qualify to become an LPR as:
* a family-based immigrant [12][13],
* an employment-based immigrant [14],
* a diversity immigrant [15],
* an asylee or refugee [16], or
* a spouse or child of someone who falls into one of the above categories.

There are a few other, less common routes to LPR status that have been omitted from the above list. Since the Immigration Act of 1990, there is no general category you can "wait in line" for. You need to qualify under one of the specific provisions of the law. [17]

In family-based and employment-based cases, you must have a petition filed by your sponsoring family member or sponsoring employer (some employment-based categories allow self-petition) and approved by USCIS in order to establish your eligibility [18][19]. For all employment-based categories and most family-based categories, there is an annual quota, so following the approval of the petition, you may need to wait months or years before it becomes your turn to apply for LPR status.

When the time finally comes for you to apply for LPR status, you can obtain that status either by applying for an immigrant visa and using it enter the US [9] or by applying for adjustment of status while already in the US [10]. For employment-based applicants, the adjustment of status route is more common, since the applicant will usually already be working for the sponsoring employer in a nonimmigrant status at the time when they become eligible to apply for LPR status.

Although adjustment of status applicants don't receive immigrant visas, it is customary to refer to both types of immigrants as immigrant visa applicants. For example, a petition such as an I-130 (family-based) or I-140 (employment-based) is referred to as an "immigrant visa petition" even though, once approved, it can be used for either an immigrant visa application *or* adjustment of status. Similarly, limitations on numbers of immigrant visas that may be issued per year also apply to adjustment of status applicants [27].

You become an LPR, and are entitled to the associated rights and privileges, as soon as you are admitted under an immigrant visa or your adjustment of status is approved. However, it takes a few months to produce the plastic green card bearing your photo and other information, which will be mailed to you when it is ready.

## What is the typical application process for employer-sponsored immigration?
See [the EB FAQ](EB.md).

## What is the 7% per-country cap?
This is a rule that [22]:
* At most 7% of the annual quota of EB visas is available to natives of any single country.
* Likewise, at most 7% of the annual quota of numerically limited family-based visas is available to natives of any single country.

This rule tends to result in long waiting times for applicants from certain countries, if they are applying for an immigrant classification that many other people from their country are also applying for. For example, family-based waiting times are very for natives of Mexico, and employment-based waiting times are very long for natives of India.

## Why are the per-country quotas on immigration based on country of birth rather than country of citizenship?
Friends who think of me as first and foremost a Canadian are sometimes surprised to hear that I have to wait a long time for a green card simply due to having been born in China. I'm not sure why the limitations are based on country of birth, but some plausible explanations include:
* The limitations are intended to ensure a certain amount of racial diversity in immigration patterns, and country of birth is viewed as a better proxy for race than present country of citizenship.
* Per-country quotas were first introduced by the Immigration Act of 1924; this was so long ago that most people didn't move around very much and some countries didn't even issue proof of citizenship, so country of birth was regarded as a practical criterion for sorting immigrants.
* Restrictions based on country of citizenship would be easier to circumvent, perhaps by "buying" citizenship in some third country.

## Can I be charged to the quota of a country other than my country of birth?
As explained above, becoming a citizen of another country doesn't affect which country you're charged to for the purposes of the 7% per-country limitation. However, under some conditions, it is possible to be charged to a different country. If your country of birth is different from that of both of your parents, and neither parent had a residence in your country of birth at the time of your birth, you may be able to be charged to one of your parents' countries of birth instead. Also, you can be "cross-charged" to your spouse's country of birth if it is different from yours [20]. The *Foreign Affairs Manual* explains that, for example, an EB-2 applicant born in India and has a spouse born in France could elect to be charged to France, thus having their priority date become current sooner [21]. (However, if your plan is to find someone to marry specifically to speed up your green card process, why not just marry an American?)

## What do I need to do in order to maintain my LPR status?
Once you are granted LPR status, you must observe many rules in order to avoid losing that status, some of which are listed here:
* Maintain your domicile in the US by living in the US and only making temporary trips abroad. This is a complex topic for which many other resources are available online, so we won't have much more to say about this here.
* Inform DHS of any change of address in the United States by filing [Form AR-11](https://www.uscis.gov/ar-11) with USCIS.
    * This is required by law and failing to do so could theoretically, by itself, serve as a ground for deportation [28]. While I'm not aware that anyone has ever been deported for this reason alone, I do not recommend handing the current administration an excuse to deport you on a silver platter.
    * More practically, if USCIS or ICE needs to send you any written communication, they will send it to your address on file. Failure to receive such communication, such as a Notice To Appear, could have adverse consequences for your immigration status.
* Keep in mind that there are various criminal convictions that can serve as grounds for inadmissibility and/or deportation [29][30]. If you consider deportation to be a more serious punishment than incarceration, you may want to be more careful than you would otherwise be when doing anything that could possibly lead to a criminal conviction.
* Do not attempt to vote. While this may seem obvious, it's easy to accidentally sign a petition for a ballot proposition (particularly in California). You should keep in mind that this is not allowed [31] until you become a US citizen and register to vote.
* Never misrepresent yourself as a US citizen [32]. You are already entitled to most of the rights that US citizens enjoy, so there is usually no reason to do so. For example, LPRs can engage in employment, invest, obtain mortgages, and purchase firearms on the same terms as US citizens.
* Never enter the United States other than at a designated port of entry [33].
* When entering the United States, have in your possession your valid unexpired green card or temporary I-551, re-entry permit, or returning resident visa [34].
* If your LPR status was granted on a conditional basis (indicated by a green card that expires 2 years after the date on which you become an LPR), you must apply to remove conditions during the 90-day period preceding said expiration [37][38][39]. Failure to do so will result in the expiration of your status, upon which you may be deported.
* If you are issued a Notice To Appear, you **must** attend (either personally or in some other prescribed manner) even if you are certain that you are not removable. Failure to attend can result in being barred from the US for 5 years [41]. If you don't attend, and the removal proceedings conclude that you are removable, then you will be ordered removed *in absentia*, which may result in being barred from the US for 10 years [40][42].

If the above rules sound burdensome to you, consider applying for naturalization once you become eligible. Naturalized US citizens are not subject to any of these restrictions.

## Do I need to carry my green card with me at all times?
Failure to carry your green card or other evidence of your LPR status while in the United States is not a deportable offense, but is a misdemeanor [35]. While few people are convicted for failing to carry their green card, it's quite possible that ICE agents demand to see your green card, refuse to believe you when you say you left it at home, and place you under detention, releasing you only once they are satisfied that you are an LPR (and there's no telling how long that will take). Why expose yourself to that risk?

## What happens when my green card expires?
If you have conditional status, your green card will expire at the same time as your status---namely, 2 years after you become an LPR. You must apply to have the conditions removed [using the appropriate form](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/conditional-permanent-residence). Upon approval of this application, you will receive a green card valid for 10 years. Failure to do so can result in removal from the United States [37].

If your 10-year green card is expiring, you are required to apply for a new card [36] using [Form I-90](https://www.uscis.gov/i-90). The expiration of a 10-year green card does not result in the loss of LPR status (see *e.g.,* [here](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/pressrelease/GreenCardRenewal_110702.pdf)), but an expired green card generally cannot be used as proof of LPR status, so failure to renew your expired card will make life more difficult for you.

## If I give up my green card, will it prevent me from applying for a green card in the future?
The voluntary loss of LPR status (*i.e.,* not as a result of being deported or removed from the United States) is not among the grounds of inadmissibility set out in INA 212(a) ([8 USC §1182(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182#a)), and therefore does not, in general, act as a bar to future admission to the US as a nonimmigrant or as an immigrant, provided that you meet all the necessary qualifications, just as is required of any other alien who was not previously an LPR.

There is a single exception: if you, as an LPR, leave the US in order to avoid the draft, you become permanently ineligible to immigrate to the US [23][24]. It is possible to return to the US temporarily (*i.e.,* as a nonimmigrant), but a waiver is required [25]. Yikes.

If you wish to return to the US as an immigrant in the future after giving up LPR status, you will need to go through the whole process all over again. You cannot reuse the priority date that you used for your previous immigrant visa application when you are applying for your new immigrant visa [26]. You might wonder if there's a loophole: if you had two I-140s approved, and you used the priority date of the earlier one for your immigrant visa application, becoming an LPR, could you later use the priority date of the later one for a subsequent immigrant visa application? The answer doesn't seem to be written down anywhere, and no immigration lawyer I spoke to had ever heard of such an unusual case. All I can say is that it would be unwise to expect this to be allowed. You should simply assume that you will have to start from scratch, with none of your old priority dates being available.
