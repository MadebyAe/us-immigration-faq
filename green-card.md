## Is applying for a green card the only way to live in the US permanently?
Yes, with a few exceptions. Almost all nonimmigrant statuses are for a limited period of time and require "nonimmigrant intent", which means that DoS and CBP have discretion to stop granting you visas/status if they can see that you are trying to live in the US permanently. Some exceptions include:
* [O-1](O-1.md) status is exempt from the requirement to maintain a residence abroad [1], and can therefore be renewed indefinitely in 3-year increments. However, you must continue to work in the area of extraordinary ability for as long as you want to remain in O-1 status.
* American Indians born in Canada may live in the US permanently and are immune to deportation [2][3].
* Most citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau may live and work in the US indefinitely under the terms of the Compact of Free Association [4][5].

## Are there any reasons why I might not want a green card?
Yes. Lawful permanent resident (LPR) status in the United States confers both rights and responsibilities. Here are some reasons why you might not want to become an LPR: 
* Permanent residents, if male and between the ages of 18 and 26, are required to register for the Selective Service [6].
* An LPR is subject to taxation as a resident alien even if they reside outside the US for most of the year [7].
* You must actually reside in the US in order to maintain the rights associated with LPR status. If you abandon your residence in the US, you will need to file Form I-407 to renounce that status before you can be readmitted to the US as a nonimmigrant. If you have been an LPR for 8 or more years at the time when you give up that status, you may be subject to an expatriation tax [8].

## How can I apply for lawful permanent residence (green card status)?
You can qualify to become an LPR as:
* a family-based immigrant [12][13],
* an employment-based immigrant [14],
* a diversity immigrant [15],
* an asylee or refugee [16], or
* a spouse or child of someone who falls into one of the above categories.

There are a few other, less common routes to LPR status that have been omitted from the above list. Since the Immigration Act of 1990, there is no general category you can "wait in line" for. You need to qualify under one of the specific provisions of the law. [17]

In family-based and employment-based cases, you must have a petition filed by your sponsoring family member or sponsoring employer (some employment-based categories allow self-petition) and approved by USCIS in order to establish your eligibility [18][19]. For all employment-based categories and most family-based categories, there is an annual quota, so following the approval of the petition, you may need to wait months or years before it becomes your turn to apply for LPR status.

When the time finally comes for you to apply for LPR status, you can obtain that status either by applying for an immigrant visa and using it enter the US [9] or by applying for adjustment of status while already in the US [10]. For employment-based applicants, the adjustment of status route is more common, since the applicant will usually already be working for the sponsoring employer in a nonimmigrant status at the time when they become eligible to apply for LPR status.

You become an LPR, and are entitled to the associated rights and privileges, as soon as you are admitted under an immigrant visa or your adjustment of status is approved. However, it takes a few months to produce the plastic green card bearing your photo and other information, which will be mailed to you when it is ready.
