## Who qualifies for TN status?
TN status is limited to citizens of Canada and Mexico [1]. Permanent residents of Canada, for example, do not qualify [4]. However, citizens of Canada and Mexico admitted in TN status can bring along their [dependents](general.md#as-a-nonimmigrant-can-i-bring-my-family-with-me-to-the-us) regardless of said dependents' nationalities [5].

A TN worker must be coming to the US as a "professional" in one of the professions listed in Appendix 1603.D.1 of NAFTA [2] and must meet the minimum credential requirement set out therein. This list of qualifying professions and minimum credentials is reproduced in the federal regulations [3]. Self-employment is not permitted [4][7].

## Does my degree have to be in the same field as my occupation?
Many of the professions that qualify for TN status require a bachelor's degree or similar credential. There is no specific requirement regarding how closely related the major area of study for the degree must be to the profession the alien intends to engage in, either in the NAFTA text [2], or in the federal regulations [3], although the State Department does seem to take the view that there must be "significant overlap" [9]. A common example is that individuals with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics or Physics often receive TN status to engage in software engineering. However, when the degree appears unrelated to the profession, there is a significant probability of being denied admission at the port of entry, or being issued a Request for Evidence (RFE) by USCIS.

As such decisions made by CBP officers are unpredictable to a certain extent, it is normally recommended that if a US employer seeks to employ someone in TN status who has an unrelated degree, the employer should file an I-129 petition with USCIS (see below) rather than having the question of the prospective employee's entitlement to TN status determined at the port of entry. This [often](https://www.google.com/search?q=TN+RFE+unrelated+degree) results in an RFE, but this can often be overcome. The legal justification for the RFE is that federal regulations require that the TN nonimmigrant must demonstrate "status as a professional" [6] which can be viewed as implicit within NAFTA, as an unqualified person cannot "engage in business activities at a professional level". While a bachelor's degree in a *related* field may meet both the explicit requirement of a degree *and* the additional requirement of status as a professional, a degree in an unrelated field may only satisfy the first criterion. Therefore, overcoming the RFE requires additional evidence that the alien has the status of a professional in the classification sought. See [8] for more detail.

## What is the advantage of TN status over H-1B?
There are at least two significant advantages.

In this day and age, the biggest advantage is that there is no limit on the number of people who can enter the US in TN status every year. Therefore, unlike [H-1B](H-1B.md) status, TN status can be obtained at any time of year, without having to wait for a visa to become available and without having to win a lottery. Although NAFTA allowed the United States to impose an annual limitation on the number of new Mexican TN professionals per year, which was initially set to 5500, this provision was scheduled to sunset within 10 years [10] Therefore, effective Jan 1, 2004, the annual limitation was repealed, so neither Canadian nor Mexican TN professionals are subject to an annual limit [11].

The second most important advantage is that the requirements for an employer to sponsor an individual for TN status are considerably less onerous than the corresponding requirements for H-1B status. In most cases, the employer merely needs to provide a letter stating that it wishes to employ the alien as a TN nonimmigrant professional, stating the profession the alien will engage in, a job description, the alien's qualifications, and the salary offered [12]. There is no requirement for the employer to file a labor condition application with the Department of Labor or to otherwise apply for or receive approval prior to the alien seeking a visa or status at the port of entry, as NAFTA forbade the imposition of labor certification requirements [14] and the ratification of NAFTA therefore carved out a statutory exception to the usual labor certification requirement of US immigration law [13].

Both of these factors make it easier for an employer to sponsor an employee for TN status than for H-1B status: the employer can fill the position immediately instead of having to deal with having to wait an uncertain number of years for the prospective employee to win the H-1B lottery, and the employer usually can provide a simple letter drafted by management and human resources instead of involving a lawyer to make a labor condition application and file an I-129 petition with USCIS. Thus, some employers that have decided not to sponsor H-1Bs may still sponsor TNs, or may be persuaded to do so.

## How do I apply for TN status?
Canadians are [visa-exempt](visas.md) [16][17], whereas Mexicans are required to obtain visas prior to arrival in the United States [15]. Thus, Canadians will usually apply for TN status directly at the port of entry, whereas Mexicans will have to appear at a consular post. Both Canadians and Mexicans must present the same documentation, namely a letter from the prospective employer that states [12][18]:

* The profession the applicant is coming to the United States to engage in, which must be one of the professions listed in NAFTA [2];
* A detailed job description;
* The anticipated length of stay (typically 3 years, as this is the maximum period of admission in TN status);
* The applicant's qualifications, which must be at least those required by NAFTA [2] such as a degree or professional license, and supported by documentation such as a university diploma;
* The salary that the applicant will be paid.

Of course, the applicant must establish Canadian or Mexican citizenship. For Mexican citizens, a Mexican passport is therefore required. For Canadian citizens, a Canadian passport is sufficient, although a NEXUS card is also accepted.

A Mexican TN visa applicant must pay the visa application fee indicated by the consular post. A Canadian citizen applying for TN status at the border must pay a fee to CBP [19]. This fee can be found at [20] and is, at the time of writing, $50. When arriving at a land border, an additional fee for I-94 issuance applies [21] which, at the time of writing, is $6.

Although Canadians usually do not need visas, they are entitled to apply for visas and be considered in the same manner as Mexican applicants. The *Foreign Affairs Manual* explains that this can sometimes be necessary when the Canadian citizen will be travelling with non-Canadian family members [22].

An alternative procedure for a Canadian citizen to be admitted as a TN nonimmigrant is to have the prospective employer file a petition with USCIS on Form I-129. The documentary evidence required will be the same, but the adjudication will be done by USCIS, and the approved petition can then be used to apply for admission at a port of entry [23][24]. The fee for this is much greater, particularly if Premium Processing is requested in order to obtain a decision within 15 days. Due to the greater fees and processing time, this method is typically only used if there is a significant risk that the applicant may not be approved for TN status if the decision is being made by the CBP officer.

Thus, there are a total of three methods:

* Canadian citizens may apply directly at the port of entry.
* Canadian citizens may bring the approval notice for Form I-129 filed by their prospective employer to the port of entry.
* Canadian and Mexican citizens may apply for a TN visa at a consular post, and present the visa at the port of entry.

## How can I switch employers?
If a TN nonimmigrant is in the United States and wishes to switch to a different employer, or to add a new employer they will work for concurrently, the new employer must file Form I-129 [24][25] with the same supporting documentation that would be required for an initial admission. The TN nonimmigrant must also provide copies of their most recent two paystubs, which will be filed as evidence with the I-129 that they were maintaining status at the time of filing. TN status does not have a "portability" provision like H-1B status does, so employment with the new employer may not begin until the Form I-129 is approved.

A Canadian citizen may also depart the United States and have the request for new employment adjudicated at a port of entry with the appropriate documentation [26][27]. This option&mdash;namely, having the request for new employment adjudicated at a port of entry&mdash;also appears to be open to Mexican citizens, although only if their TN visa has not yet expired [26][29].

A Mexican citizen can have the request for new employment adjudicated at a consular post (presumably, this option is also open to Canadian citizens, though rarely used). If this request is approved, the new employer will be added as an annotation on the TN visa [28]. Of course, it is also permissible to apply for a new TN visa, and this would be required if the old visa had already expired.

Although this is not explicitly stated, it appears that the intent is that the approval of Form I-129 requesting the addition of a new employer avoids the need to re-adjudicate the matter at a consular post. Thus, a Mexican citizen whose new employment was approved by USCIS pursuant to the filing of Form I-129 would *not* need to also have the new employer added directly on their TN visa [30][31]. However, a visit to the consulate would obviously be necessary if the previously issued visa had already expired.

## How long is TN status valid for?
A TN nonimmigrant may be admitted for up to three years [19] and may travel out of the US and seek re-admission within that three-year period [32]. A new three-year period may be requested either by filing Form I-129, or by presenting the same documentation at the port of entry as would be required for an initial admission [33]; of course, in the case of a Mexican citizen, if their visa has expired, a new visa must be obtained as well.

There is no limit on the number of times that TN status can be "renewed". However, lengthy periods of stay in TN status may eventually result in the TN nonimmigrant no longer being able to overcome the presumption of immigrant intent, resulting in a denial of further TN visa renewals or subsequent admissions at the port of entry [34][35][36]. The *Foreign Affairs Manual* states that TN applicants are required to "demonstrate ... their maintenance of a residence abroad" but this requirement is not consistently enforced, and may be an error, as the requirement to maintain a residence abroad is not found in the Immigration and Nationality Act [38], and elsewhere in the *FAM*, it is stated that it does not apply to TN applicants [37].

Although it is conceded that extended periods of stay in TN status may eventually result in a denial, there does not appear to be any specific guidance regarding how long is too long. There are, however, anecdotal reports of being denied admission as a result of admitting to CBP officers in some way that their intent is non-temporary. It is therefore recommended that applicants for TN status should, upon each instance of seeking entry (including the very first one) be prepared to, if questioned by the officer, make *truthful* statements consistent with the following:

1. That their employer has requested their services for the period of time indicated;
2. That they do not currently have any specific plans regarding their future activities beyond the end of the period of time indicated;
3. That they currently intend to return to Canada or Mexico upon completion of their assignment.

## What happens if I apply for a green card while in TN status?
The [employment-based green card process](EB.md) involves Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. In most cases, the Department of Labor must approve a labor certification before Form I-140 can be filed with USCIS.

The labor certification process has no effect on TN status because it is filed with the Department of Labor. Once Form I-140 is filed, regardless of whether it is pending or approved, USCIS is aware that the beneficiary may use it to immigrate in the future. Similarly, when seeking readmission at a port of entry, CBP can see that the I-140 was filed. When applying to renew a TN visa at a consulate, the nonimmigrant visa application form asks whether an immigrant petition has ever been filed on your behalf, and you are required to answer truthfully. Thus, the possibility exists that renewal of a TN visa, extension of TN status, or readmission in TN status may be denied on the basis of the I-140.

However, CBP has said on at least two occasions, in 1996 [39] and 2008 [40], that the I-140 alone is not sufficient grounds for an INA 214(b) denial. This is consistent with the State Department's guidance [34] that *"An intent to immigrate in the future that is in no way connected to the proposed immediate trip need not in itself result in a finding that the immediate trip is not temporary."* (In fact, this is similar to the standard that is applied to B visa applicants [41]. Otherwise, aliens waiting in long queues for family-based immigrant visas would not be able to visit their family in the US during their wait.) Thus, the I-140 should not pose an issue as long as the TN nonimmigrant has no immediate intent to immigrate. Of course, one's intent can change later, so, contrary to popular belief, moving to the final I-485 filing stage while in TN status is not necessarily considered fraudulent. However, it is generally advised that the I-485 be filed more than 90 days after the most recent admission in TN status in order to avoid triggering a finding that the alien misrepresented their intent at the time of admission (see *e.g.* [42] and [43]).

Once Form I-485 has been filed, of course, one could not seek an extension of TN status as the filing of Form I-485 indicates an unambiguous intent to remain permanently. Nor could one, after filing Form I-485, expect to be able to travel and be re-admitted in TN status. An individual in TN status with a pending I-485 must apply for and receive advance parole before leaving the US, otherwise the I-485 is considered abandoned [44]. Upon return to the US, since the alien would not be eligible for TN status, they must use their advance parole, and will be paroled, rather than admitted. Thus, filing for adjustment of status while in TN status carries the following risks:

1. That the applicant might have a family emergency or other circumstance requiring them to travel abroad after the I-485 filing but before advance parole is granted (which takes a few months). Such an alien would not only abandon their I-485, but would have difficulty in being re-admitted in TN status since they recently demonstrated an unambiguous intent to immigrate (even if temporarily abandoned).
2. That the applicant, after receiving advance parole, travels and returns to the US and their I-485 is denied. Such an applicant, having not been admitted, would not be eligible to retry filing the I-485 [45][46]. Instead, they would typically be forced to depart the US and apply for an immigrant visa at a consular post in lieu of re-filing the I-485, which could disrupt their employment and family ties in the US.
3. That the applicant's TN status would expire while Form I-485 is pending; the subsequent denial of the I-485 would then pose issues similar to those described in item 2. However, this risk can be minimized by proper timing (*i.e.,* so that your I-94 will still be valid for 2+ years at the time that Form I-485 is filed). In particular, for Rest of World applicants (born in neither India nor China), it's usually possible to complete the entire green card process before the initial 3-year period of admission expires.

If you are interested in pursuing a green card while in TN status, be sure to discuss the risks with your lawyer. If you were born in India or China, it would also be advisable to have your employer try to switch you to [H-1B](H-1B.md) status each year while you wait for your priority date to become current, since all of the risks discussed here vanish once you receive an H-1B visa (or, in the case of a Canadian citizen, have an approved Form I-129 for H-1B classification). Many immigration lawyers have traditionally recommended waiting for H-1B approval before starting the green card process. However, for natives of India, as the EB-2 and EB-3 backlogs grow longer every year, getting an I-140 approved as soon as possible, without waiting to win the H-1B lottery, may minimize the amount of time you will have to spend waiting for a immigrant visa number; and in the early years, when your priority date is from being current, the I-140 is unlikely to cause any issues with TN status, as immigrating on the "proposed immediate trip" is not even a legal option.

The reader of this FAQ may wish to read a [well-known thread](https://forums.immigration.com/threads/i-am-no-longer-curious-i-am-appppprrrroooooveeedd.141272/#post-1041766) which discusses the experience of pursuing a green card while in TN status. (However, while curiousGeorge suggests that applying for a TN "with a **new** company once you've filed an I-140" will cause problems, there does not seem to be any evidence that this is particularly problematic. Indeed, switching companies should *reduce* the suspicion of immigrant intent, since the new company would need to file a new I-140.)
