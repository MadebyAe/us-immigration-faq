## Who qualifies for TN status?
TN status is limited to citizens of Canada and Mexico [1]. Permanent residents of Canada, for example, do not qualify [4]. However, citizens of Canada and Mexico admitted in TN status can bring along their [dependents](general.md#as-a-nonimmigrant-can-i-bring-my-family-with-me-to-the-us) regardless of said dependents' nationalities [5].

A TN worker must be coming to the US as a "professional" in one of the professions listed in Appendix 1603.D.1 of NAFTA [2] and must meet the minimum credential requirement set out therein. This list of qualifying professions and minimum credentials is reproduced in the federal regulations [3]. Self-employment is not permitted [4][7].

## What is the advantage of TN status over H-1B?
There are at least two significant advantages.

In this day and age, the biggest advantage is that there is no limit on the number of people who can enter the US in TN status every year. Therefore, unlike [H-1B](H-1B.md) status, TN status can be obtained at any time of year, without having to wait for a visa to become available and without having to win a lottery. Although NAFTA allowed the United States to impose an annual limitation on the number of new Mexican TN professionals per year, which was initially set to 5500, this provision was scheduled to sunset within 10 years [10] Therefore, effective Jan 1, 2004, the annual limitation was repealed, so neither Canadian nor Mexican TN professionals are subject to an annual limit [11].

The second most important advantage is that the requirements for an employer to sponsor an individual for TN status are considerably less onerous than the corresponding requirements for H-1B status. In most cases, the employer merely needs to provide a letter stating that it wishes to employ the alien as a TN nonimmigrant professional, stating the profession the alien will engage in, a job description, the alien's qualifications, and the salary offered [12]. There is no requirement for the employer to file a labor condition application with the Department of Labor or to otherwise apply for or receive approval prior to the alien seeking a visa or status at the port of entry, as NAFTA forbade the imposition of labor certification requirements [14] and the ratification of NAFTA therefore carved out a statutory exception to the usual labor certification requirement of US immigration law [13].

Both of these factors make it easier for an employer to sponsor an employee for TN status than for H-1B status: the employer can fill the position immediately instead of having to deal with having to wait an uncertain number of years for the prospective employee to win the H-1B lottery, and the employer usually can provide a simple letter drafted by management and human resources instead of involving a lawyer to make a labor condition application and file an I-129 petition with USCIS. Thus, some employers that have decided not to sponsor H-1Bs may still sponsor TNs, or may be persuaded to do so.

## Does my degree have to be in the same field as my occupation?
Many of the professions that qualify for TN status require a bachelor's degree or similar credential. There is no specific requirement regarding how closely related the major area of study for the degree must be to the profession the alien intends to engage in, either in the NAFTA text [2], or in the federal regulations [3], although the State Department does seem to take the view that there must be "significant overlap" [9]. A common example is that individuals with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics or Physics often receive TN status to engage in software engineering. However, when the degree appears unrelated to the profession, there is a significant probability of being denied admission at the port of entry, or being issued a Request for Evidence (RFE) by USCIS.

As such decisions made by CBP officers are unpredictable to a certain extent, it is normally recommended that if a US employer seeks to employ someone in TN status who has an unrelated degree, the employer should file an I-129 petition with USCIS (see below) rather than having the question of the prospective employee's entitlement to TN status determined at the port of entry. This [often](https://www.google.com/search?q=TN+RFE+unrelated+degree) results in an RFE, but this can often be overcome. The legal justification for the RFE is that federal regulations require that the TN nonimmigrant must demonstrate "status as a professional" [6] which can be viewed as implicit within NAFTA, as an unqualified person cannot "engage in business activities at a professional level". While a bachelor's degree in a *related* field may meet both the explicit requirement of a degree *and* the additional requirement of status as a professional, a degree in an unrelated field may only satisfy the first criterion. Therefore, overcoming the RFE requires additional evidence that the alien has the status of a professional in the classification sought. See [8] for more detail.
