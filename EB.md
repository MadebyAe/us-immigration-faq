## What do the acronyms EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 stand for?
These codes are [used by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers) to refer to the three levels of *preference* [10] for employment-based immigrants, into which most employment-based immigrants fall:
1. Aliens with extraordinary ability (EB-1A), outstanding professors and researchers (EB-1B), and multinational managers and executives (EB-1C).
2. Aliens with advanced degrees (master's or higher) or exceptional ability. [9]
3. Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers.

Each preference level has its own annual quota. If the EB-1 quota is not completely used up, the unused numbers "spill over", that is, become available for EB-2 applicants. Likewise, any unused numbers from EB-2 spill over into EB-3 [10]. In general, fewer people qualify for EB-1 than EB-2 and fewer qualify for EB-2 than EB-3, so waiting times are usually shorter for EB-1 than EB-2 and shorter for EB-2 than EB-3. However, this is not always the case.

## What is the typical application process for employment-sponsored immigration?
Most employment-based immigrants will fall under Third Preference or Second Preference (advanced degree, not exceptional ability) and will need to be sponsored by an employer and go through the following steps:

1. Labor certification, in which the employer must establish, and the Department of Labor must agree, that they need to fill a position in the United States and cannot fill it by hiring a U.S. worker [1][2][3][4]. Large tech companies such as Google usually have well-established procedures to maximize the chances of approval of the labor certification for software engineers and other technical employees. However, getting a labor certification approved can be a (sometimes insurmountable) challenge for smaller employers and for employers seeking to sponsor employees for non-STEM roles. The acronym *PERM*, referring to the electronic system for labor certification, is often used as a metonym for the labor certification process.
2. Filing and approval of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker by the sponsoring employer [5].
3. Filing and approval of Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status [6].

Your *priority date* is the date on which the labor certification application was accepted for processing by the Department of Labor [7]. This priority date represents your place in line; other employment-based immigration applicants who filed before you will be eligible to receive an immigrant visa or adjustment of status from the annually limited pool before you. You can apply for adjustment of status once the cut-off date published by the State Department becomes later than your priority date [8]. If, upon labor certification approval, the cut-off date is later than your priority date, then you can file Forms I-140 and I-485 concurrently. Otherwise, your employer or authorized representative will file Form I-140 first, the approval of which "locks in" your priority date, and you will have to wait for your priority date to become current before you can file Form I-485.

## I don't think I have any skills that US-based workers don't have. Can my labor certification be approved?
You may be more unique than you believe, and your employer, working together with a good immigration law firm, will try to make that case. Your employer might be sponsoring you for a role that requires experience in specific areas, say, MapReduce together with C++ API design. If you're an experienced software engineer, you probably have many skills that allow you to contribute to the company in a specific and valuable capacity. Even if you're a new grad, you might have done internships or taken specific courses where you learned such specific skills. If not, then in a couple of years, you might have acquired such skills through your full-time experience, and at that point you may be able to start the labor certification process.

It does tend to be more difficult to hire foreign nationals on a permanent basis for non-STEM jobs, unfortunately. Many employers won't even try.

## How long does the labor certification process take?
Between a few months and a year. When immigration lawyers tell you that it's difficult to predict how long this takes, they're not just hedging their words. It's actually quite unpredictable, since it involves three steps, each of which takes an uncertain amount of time:
1. Prevailing wage determination by the Department of Labor, in which the DOL determines how much compensation the employer must offer to U.S. workers in order to entice them to apply for the job;
2. Recruitment, in which your sponsoring employer attempts to recruit a U.S. worker for the position at the prevailing wage, and documents their failure to do so;
3. The application for the labor certification itself, submitted to DOL, which takes time to process, and which may or may not be audited by DOL (meaning that they don't believe the company and will watch them closely as they again attempt to recruit U.S. workers for the position), adding a few more months.

You are also responsible for obtaining letters signed by your former employers' HR departments, your former managers, or other individuals who can attest that you gained the experience required for the role in question while working with them. This can occasionally be difficult. If you can't obtain these letters or if it takes a long time to do so, the labor certification process can be delayed.

## How long does the I-140 take?
This question is usually easy to answer; USCIS provides a [website](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) where you can look up how backlogged they are. For example, if it tells you that they're currently processing I-140s filed 5 months ago, then you can estimate that your I-140 will take about 5 months to get approved. Unfortunately, that website appears to be broken at the time of writing this answer. Hopefully they'll fix it soon.

It's possible to expedite the I-140 by paying a $1225 [premium processing](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/how-do-i-use-premium-processing-service) fee. If USCIS accepts the fee, they will either render a decision within 15 calendar days or refund the fee. Unfortunately, sometimes they will simply flat-out reject the fee, saying that premium processing isn't available at the moment.

If your employer doesn't pay the premium processing fee for you, they may give you the option of paying it yourself. In cases where you will have to wait many years before filing the I-485, getting premium processing for the I-140 doesn't speed this up, because your priority date is determined by when the labor certification application was filed, not by when the I-140 gets approved. Nevertheless, Brian highly recommends getting premium processing, because the sooner your I-140 is approved, the sooner you can rest assured that your priority date has been locked in. Then, even if you are fired or laid off, or you quit, the priority date will be retained for future immigration applications by another employer (see below for more information).

## How long will I have to wait before my priority date becomes current?
You are sorted into a bucket based on your preference category (EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3) and your country of birth. The reason why country of birth is relevant is that no more than 7% of the annual EB quota can be used by natives of any single country [11]. As a consequence of this rule:
* EB-2 and EB-3 waiting times for people born in India are in the decades. The [December 2018 visa bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2019/visa-bulletin-for-december-2018.html) shows that individuals who applied back in 2009 are having their priority dates become current this year. However, because of high numbers of applicants in recent years, the cut-off dates move forward by only 1 to 2 weeks per month. This means that if your priority date is in 2018 then you will probably have to wait for much longer than 9 years.
* EB-2 and EB-3 waiting times are a few years for people born in (mainland) China.
* Waiting times tend to be shorter for EB-2 and EB-3 applicants not born in China or India, and for EB-1 applicants. Often, these categories are "current", meaning that Form I-485 should be filed without delay.

You can find out which priority dates are becoming current each month by reading the [visa bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html). You'll have to compare cut-off dates across multiple editions of the visa bulletin to get a sense of how quickly each bucket is moving.

Unfortunately, USCIS doesn't publish information about how many people are waiting to adjust status in each bucket, so it's impossible to produce *accurate* estimates for when you'll reach the front of the line.

## I was born in India. What's the point of applying for a green card if I'll probably die of old age before I get it?
Having an approved I-140 exempts you from the 6 year limit on [H-1B](H-1B.md) time [12][13]. Therefore, most Indians who want to work in the US indefinitely should apply for a green card and, while waiting, continue to extend their H-1B status. Otherwise, once they've used up their 6 years of H-1B time, they have to spend a year physically outside the US before they can qualify for H-1B status again [14].

## If I switch employers, do I have to start the whole green card process over again?
Usually, you will have to start the whole process over again, but you will get to keep the priority date from your earliest approved petition. For example, Brian's priority date established by the approval of Form I-140 filed by his previous employer, Google, is September 26, 2016. Brian's new employer, Citadel Securities, has to go through the labor certification and I-140 filing process again, but once the new I-140 is approved, Brian's priority date will still be September 26, 2016. The priority date can be retained as long as the original I-140 was for EB-1, EB-2 or EB-3 classification and the new I-140 is also for EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 classification (even if different from that of the original) [15]. Indeed, even if the previous employer withdraws the I-140 they filed on your behalf, you can still retain the priority date, since withdrawal by petitioner is not among the grounds for ineligibility of priority date retention [16][17].

Thus, once you find an employer willing to sponsor you for a green card, but you want to switch companies, it may be wise to  wait until after the I-140 is approved before switching. Thanks to priority date retention, applicants who will have to wait a long time for their priority date to be current can switch employers without delaying their eventual adjustment of status, provided that they are the beneficiary of at least one I-140 that was approved at any point in the past.

As an exception, if your I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, you can switch jobs to a new employer in "the same or a similar occupational classification" without having the new employer go through the employment-based sponsorship process [18][19].

## Why should I wait for 180 days after I-140 approval before switching jobs?
If an I-140 remains approved for at least 180 days before being withdrawn by the sponsoring employer, it *remains approved* despite having been withdrawn [20]. Thus, you might want to stay for 180 days so that your employer doesn't withdraw the I-140 within that time period, and the I-140 will remain approved after you leave.

However, for priority date retention, this actually doesn't matter. Priority date retention under [16][17] only requires that you have an I-140 *that was once approved*. So even if it becomes revoked because the sponsoring employer withdrew it within 180 days, this doesn't affect your ability to retain the priority date.

Where it *does* matter is for post 6th-year H-1B extensions [13], which require a *currently approved* I-140. Thus, staying at the employer that sponsored the I-140 for at least 180 days after approval helps to prevent possible interruption in your work authorization when you switch to a new employer.
