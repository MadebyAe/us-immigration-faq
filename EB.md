## What do the acronyms EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 stand for?
These codes are [used by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers) to refer to the three levels of *preference* [10] for employment-based immigrants, into which most employment-based immigrants fall:
1. Aliens with extraordinary ability (EB-1A), outstanding professors and researchers (EB-1B), and multinational managers and executives (EB-1C).
2. Aliens with advanced degrees (master's or higher) or exceptional ability. [9]
3. Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers.

Each preference level has its own annual quota. If the EB-1 quota is not completely used up, the unused numbers "spill over", that is, become available for EB-2 applicants. Likewise, any unused numbers from EB-2 spill over into EB-3 [10]. In general, fewer people qualify for EB-1 than EB-2 and fewer qualify for EB-2 than EB-3, so waiting times are usually shorter for EB-1 than EB-2 and shorter for EB-2 than EB-3. However, this is not always the case.

## What is the typical application process for employment-sponsored immigration?
Most employment-based immigrants will fall under Third Preference or Second Preference (advanced degree, not exceptional ability) and will need to be sponsored by an employer and go through the following steps:

1. Labor certification, in which the employer must establish, and the Department of Labor must agree, that they need to fill a position in the United States and cannot fill it by hiring a U.S. worker [1][2][3][4].
2. Filing and approval of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker by the sponsoring employer [5].
3. Filing and approval of Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status [6].

Arguably, there is also "step 0", which is to get a job that offers green card sponsorship in the first place, which is fairly difficult. Many software engineering jobs do offer green card sponsorship, but employers are usually only willing to start the green card process after the employee starts working at one of the employer's US offices, which is itself not always easy, given visa requirements. Outside the software engineering sector, relatively few jobs offer green card sponsorship. This is partially because step 1 is expensive and often difficult, which acts as a deterrent to sponsoring foreign nationals. Large tech companies such as Google usually have well-established procedures to maximize the chances of approval of the labor certification for software engineers and other technical employees. However, getting a labor certification approved can be a (sometimes insurmountable) challenge for smaller employers and for employers seeking to sponsor employees for non-STEM roles.

The acronym *PERM*, referring to the electronic system for labor certification, is often used as a metonym for the labor certification process.

Your *priority date* is the date on which the labor certification application was accepted for processing by the Department of Labor [7]. This priority date represents your place in line; other employment-based immigration applicants who filed before you will be eligible to receive an immigrant visa or adjustment of status from the annually limited pool before you. You can apply for adjustment of status once the cut-off date published by the State Department becomes later than your priority date [8]. If, upon labor certification approval, the cut-off date is later than your priority date, then you can file Forms I-140 and I-485 concurrently. Otherwise, your employer or authorized representative will file Form I-140 first, the approval of which "locks in" your priority date, and you will have to wait for your priority date to become current before you can file Form I-485.

## Which employment-based immigration categories don't require a sponsoring employer?
Aliens with extraordinary ability may self-petition for EB-1A classification [21]. This petition does not require a sponsoring employer; the alien may file it on their own behalf. However, a prospective employer *may* be involved in the petitioning process (*e.g.,* by paying legal fees); indeed, a job offer with a high level of compensation may be used as one piece of evidence for the alien's claim to extraordinary ability [22].

Aliens with exceptional ability, who believe that their employment in the United States would greatly benefit the nation, may self-petition for EB-2 classification and request a National Interest Waiver (NIW) in lieu of obtaining sponsorship from a US employer [23][24]. Again, a prospective employer *may* be involved, but does not have to be.

## Which employment-based immigration categories don't require a labor certification?
The labor certification process usually takes several months (see below) so, if you're appropriately qualified, you might want to be apply for a category that doesn't require a labor certification, in order to get approved as quickly as possible.

By statute, the labor certification requirement applies to EB-2 and EB-3 classifications [25]. Therefore aliens who apply for EB-1 classification for extraordinary ability, as outstanding professor or researcher, or multinational manager or executive, are not subject to the labor certification requirement [26][27][28]. Outstanding professors and researchers do require a job offer for an appropriate teaching or research position from an appropriate institution, but a labor certification is not required; only an offer letter from the institution is required [27]. Multinational managers and executives must, of course, have a qualifying job offer, and the employer must provide evidence that the job meets the requirements of the EB-1C classification, but still, no labor certification is required [28].

Aliens with exceptional ability who qualify for an EB-2 National Interest Waiver (as discussed above) do not require a labor certification [24].

In all cases, Form I-140 must be used [5], and if a sponsoring employer is required, then Form I-140 must be filed by the employer or authorized representative thereof [29]. So there are basically three sets of steps, depending on which classification you are seeking:

* (EB-3 and most EB-2 cases) Find a sponsoring employer, have them file a labor certification, have them file Form I-140, and then file Form I-485; or
* (EB-1B and EB-1C cases) Find an employer willing to offer you an appropriate position, have them file Form I-140 with an offer letter and other required evidence, and then file Form I-485; or
* (EB-1A and EB-2 NIW cases) File form I-140, and then file form I-485.

The EB-1A, EB-1B, and EB-2 NIW routes are therefore often faster than other routes, but relatively few people have a sufficient level of accomplishment to qualify for them.

## I don't think I have any skills that US-based workers don't have. Can my labor certification be approved?
You may be more unique than you believe, and your employer, working together with a good immigration law firm, will try to make that case. Your employer might be sponsoring you for a role that requires experience in specific areas, say, MapReduce together with C++ API design. If you're an experienced software engineer, you probably have many skills that allow you to contribute to the company in a specific and valuable capacity. Even if you're a new grad, you might have done internships or taken specific courses where you learned such specific skills. If not, then in a couple of years, you might have acquired such skills through your full-time experience, and at that point you may be able to start the labor certification process.

It does tend to be more difficult to hire foreign nationals on a permanent basis for non-STEM jobs, unfortunately. Many employers won't even try.

## How long does the labor certification process take?
Between a few months and a year. When immigration lawyers tell you that it's difficult to predict how long this takes, they're not just hedging their words. It's actually quite unpredictable, since it involves three steps, each of which takes an uncertain amount of time:
1. Prevailing wage determination by the Department of Labor, in which the DOL determines how much compensation the employer must offer to U.S. workers in order to entice them to apply for the job;
2. Recruitment, in which your sponsoring employer attempts to recruit a U.S. worker for the position at the prevailing wage, and documents their failure to do so;
3. The application for the labor certification itself, submitted to DOL, which takes time to process, and which may or may not be audited by DOL (meaning that they don't believe the company and will watch them closely as they again attempt to recruit U.S. workers for the position), adding a few more months.

The process can be sped up by "guessing" what the prevailing wage is going to be, and then recruiting at or above that wage level while waiting for the DOL to issue the prevailing wage determination. However, if the DOL's prevailing wage ends up being higher than anticipated, the recruitment process has to be started all over again at the prevailing wage.

You are also responsible for obtaining letters signed by your former employers' HR departments, your former managers, or other individuals who can attest that you gained the experience required for the role in question while working with them. Typically, the employer's lawyers will draft a job description for your case and ask you to obtain letters from your previous employers that attest to the fact that you have all the qualifications in the job description. (This can occasionally be difficult.) If you're not able to obtain these letters in a timely fashion, the employer may not be willing to begin the recruitment and prevailing wage determination steps, since they will be useless unless you're able to get the required letters. If the employer begins the recruitment and prevailing wage determination but in the end, you're not able to obtain some of the letters, it will probably be necessary to edit the job description (to only contain qualifications you're actually able to prove) and begin the process over again. Thus, this can introduce delays.

## How long does the I-140 take?
This question is usually easy to answer; USCIS provides a [website](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) where you can look up how backlogged they are. For example, if it tells you that they're currently processing I-140s filed 5 months ago, then you can estimate that your I-140 will take about 5 months to get approved. Unfortunately, that website appears to be broken at the time of writing this answer. Hopefully they'll fix it soon.

It's possible to expedite the I-140 by paying a $1225 [premium processing](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/how-do-i-use-premium-processing-service) fee. If USCIS accepts the fee, they will either render a decision within 15 calendar days or refund the fee. Unfortunately, sometimes they will simply flat-out reject the fee, saying that premium processing isn't available at the moment.

If your employer doesn't pay the premium processing fee for you, they may give you the option of paying it yourself. In cases where you will have to wait many years before filing the I-485, getting premium processing for the I-140 doesn't speed this up, because your priority date is determined by when the labor certification application was filed, not by when the I-140 gets approved. Nevertheless, Brian highly recommends getting premium processing, because the sooner your I-140 is approved, the sooner you can rest assured that your priority date has been locked in. Then, even if you are fired or laid off, or you quit, the priority date will be retained for future immigration applications by another employer (see below for more information).

## How long will I have to wait before my priority date becomes current?
You are sorted into a bucket based on your preference category (EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3) and your country of birth. The reason why country of birth is relevant is that no more than 7% of the annual EB quota can be used by natives of any single country [11]. As a consequence of this rule:
* EB-2 and EB-3 waiting times for people born in India are in the decades. The [December 2018 visa bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2019/visa-bulletin-for-december-2018.html) shows that individuals who applied back in 2009 are having their priority dates become current this year. However, because of high numbers of applicants in recent years, the cut-off dates move forward by only 1 to 2 weeks per month. This means that if your priority date is in 2018 then you will probably have to wait for much longer than 9 years.
* EB-2 and EB-3 waiting times are a few years for people born in (mainland) China.
* Waiting times tend to be shorter for EB-2 and EB-3 applicants not born in China or India, and for EB-1 applicants. Often, these categories are "current", meaning that Form I-485 should be filed without delay.

Note that EB-2 Advanced Degree, EB-2 Exceptional Ability, and EB-2 Exceptional Ability National Interest Waiver cases all have the same priority level. Getting a National Interest Waiver does not put you at the front of the EB-2 queue. Thus, Indians and Chinese cannot avoid the long waiting times by qualifying for a National Interest Waiver.

You can find out which priority dates are becoming current each month by reading the [visa bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html). You'll have to compare cut-off dates across multiple editions of the visa bulletin to get a sense of how quickly each bucket is moving.

Unfortunately, USCIS doesn't publish information about how many people are waiting to adjust status in each bucket, so it's impossible to produce *accurate* estimates for when you'll reach the front of the line.

## I was born in India. What's the point of applying for a green card if I'll probably die of old age before I get it?
Having an approved I-140 exempts you from the 6 year limit on [H-1B](H-1B.md) time [12][13]. Therefore, most Indians who want to work in the US indefinitely should apply for a green card and, while waiting, continue to extend their H-1B status. Otherwise, once they've used up their 6 years of H-1B time, they have to spend a year physically outside the US before they can qualify for H-1B status again [14].

## If I switch employers, do I have to start the whole green card process over again?
The answer depends on whether or not the classification you're applying for requires a sponsoring employer.

As discussed above, the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW classifications don't require a sponsoring employer. Therefore, the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW processes do not need to be restarted when changing employers. However, in order for your Form I-485 to be approved, you must continue to be eligible for the classification granted by your I-140 [30]; therefore switching *occupational fields* may cause issues, which we won't get into here, as it is not a common scenario.

As the other categories are tied to a specific employer, and the Form I-140 filed by the employer is only valid for the job offer from that particular employer, you cannot move to the I-485 stage if the job offer on which Form I-140 was based is no longer available to you [31]. Usually (but not always), if you are going to switch jobs, it means you don't have the intention of working at the original employer anymore, and that employer is no longer holding a future job open for you, so that means there is no longer a valid job offer for immigration purposes, and it follows that you would need a new I-140 in order to move on to the I-485 stage.

If your new I-140 is for a classification that requires a labor certification, then the new employer would have to go through the labor certification process. Any previous labor certification could not be re-used to file a new I-140 since the I-140 is for a specific job offer and the required labor certification would need to be for that particular job.

However, once you have an approved Form I-140 for any EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 classification, if you later file a new Form I-140 or have a new Form I-140 filed on your behalf, and it is also for an EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 classification (it may be for the same classification as the old I-140, or for a different one) then the new Form I-140, when approved, would receive the priority date of the old I-140 [15]. Indeed, even if the previous employer withdraws the I-140 they filed on your behalf, this does not stop you from retaining the priority date according to the AC21 regulations [16][17], regardless of whether the new I-140 is filed before or after the old I-140 was revoked. **There is no 180-day waiting period for priority date retention; a priority date becomes portable as soon as the original I-140 is approved and withdrawal does not remove portability** (see below).

Thus, once you find an employer willing to sponsor you for a green card, but you want to switch companies, it may be wise to wait until after the I-140 is approved before switching, thus ensuring that you will lock in your priority date as early as possible. If you are from an oversubscribed country&mdash;meaning that it will be many years before you're eligible to file Form I-485&mdash;you can switch employers without delaying the green card process, as long as you had an approved Form I-140 with the original employer, and the new employer is able to get a new Form I-140 approved by the time your priority date becomes current.

If the new classification does not require a labor certification, then obviously it would not be necessary to redo the labor certification process. For example, an EB-1B researcher changing institutions would need a new Form I-140 filed by the new institution in order to demonstrate that there is a qualifying job offer from the new institution, but no labor certification would be required.

The EB-1C classification is a special case because it requires the multinational manager or executive to have been employed by the *same* employer or by an affiliate or subsidiary outside the United States for at least 1 year (see [32] for more information). Therefore, if an alien with an approved EB-1C petition who is currently working for the sponsoring employer wishes to switch to a new employer, they would need a new I-140 filed by the new employer and if they wanted the new I-140 to also be in the EB-1C classification, they would need to leave the United States for 1 year to work for the new employer in order to be eligible for that new I-140. That being said, a beneficiary of an EB-1C petition may decide to seek a different classification such as EB-2 or EB-3 with the new employer, removing the need to leave the US for 1 year; the priority date could be retained. This may not be of much use for Indian beneficiaries, however, since a given priority date would take much longer to become current in the EB-2 or EB-3 classifications than in EB-1.

There is a special I-485 portability rule that applies if your I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, which eliminates the need for a new labor certification and new I-140 provided that the new employment is in "the same or a similar occupational classification" [18][19]. This portability rule is available for all classifications that require a job offer, namely EB-1B, EB-1C, EB-2 (except NIW), and EB-3. (An EB-1A or EB-2 NIW applicant would have no need for it.) We will discuss this portability rule further in a separate section below.

## Why should I wait for 180 days after I-140 approval before switching jobs?
If an I-140 remains approved for at least 180 days before being withdrawn by the sponsoring employer, it *remains approved* despite having been withdrawn [20]. Thus, you might want to stay for 180 days so that your employer doesn't withdraw the I-140 within that time period, and the I-140 will remain approved after you leave.

However, for priority date retention, this actually doesn't matter. Priority date retention under [16][17] only requires that you have an I-140 *that was once approved*. So even if it becomes revoked because the sponsoring employer withdrew it within 180 days, this doesn't affect your ability to retain the priority date. In other words, you can leave right after the I-140 is approved, and even if the employer withdraws it, you can still retain the priority date.

Where it *does* matter is for post 6th-year H-1B extensions [13], which require a *currently approved* I-140. Thus, if an approved I-140 is withdrawn within 180 days of approval, that I-140 can no longer be used for post 6th-year H-1B extensions. If it is withdrawn after 180 days of approval, it remains approved and can still be used for post 6th-year H-1B extensions. Staying at the employer that sponsored the I-140 for at least 180 days after approval therefore helps to prevent possible interruption in your work authorization (due to possible ineligibility H-1B extensions) when you switch to a new employer.

## How can I port my I-485 to another job?
First of all, if you are applying in the EB-1A or EB-2 NIW category, then your eligibility is not based on a particular job offer. Here, we will only be discussing the case where the I-485 is based on a specific job offer in the EB-1B, EB-1C, EB-2 (except NIW), or EB-3 categories.

Recall that when you file Form I-485, it has to be based on an I-140 representing a valid *future* job offer. Note that if you have multiple approved I-140s, including some from job offers that have been withdrawn or are otherwise no longer valid, then you can file Form I-485 based on the earliest priority date. However, regardless of which I-140 you got your priority date from, your I-485 must be filed on the basis of one particular I-140 whose job offer is currently valid (meaning that the employer intends for you to begin or continue doing that job when your I-485 is approved) [37]. In effect, the I-485 is a petition for USCIS to grant you LPR status so that you can do that job on a permanent basis. ("Permanent" does not mean "eternal"; see below.)

You do not necessarily need to be working for the sponsoring employer when your I-140 and I-485 are filed. However, the intent must exist for you to work there after your I-485 is approved. That intent must exist at both the time when the I-485 is filed, and at the time when it is adjudicated (usually several months later, although it can occasionally take up to 2 years) [37]. In many cases, the applicant will be working for the I-140 sponsor as a nonimmigrant worker (*e.g.*, in H-1B or L-1 status) at the time when the I-140 is filed, at the time when the I-485 is filed, and at the time when the I-485 is approved. In that case, the requisite job offer and intent exist throughout the process.

However, once the I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, you are allowed to "replace" the job offer that it is based on. That is, you may abandon the intent to work for the I-140 sponsor (or said sponsor may withdraw its intent to employ you), and the I-485 may be adjudicated on the basis of a different job offer: that is, at the time of adjudication, you must have the intent to do a job upon approval, but that job doesn't have to be the same one as the I-140 job. Furthermore, **a new I-140 is not required for the new job offer.** In order to qualify for this portability rule, the new job has to be in "the same or a similar occupational classification" as the I-140 job offer [18]. If this condition is not met, then a new I-140 would be required (including a new labor certification, in the EB-2 and EB-3 cases).

In order to apply for I-485 portability, you have to complete Form I-485J, also known as Supplement J to Form I-485 [37]. Form I-485J can only be filed once Form I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days and a new job offer exists in the same or a similar occupational classification. You can file Supplement J prospectively in order to check whether USCIS considers your new job offer to be valid for porting, or you can file it when USCIS asks for it (such as in response to an RFE or NOID [38], or by bringing it to the interview). Some people have reported that Supplement J simply gets lost in the shuffle when filed prospectively, so this is not necessarily recommended. If you have some doubt about whether the new job offer is similar enough to the I-140 job offer, and the best strategy for filing Supplement J in your case, consult your prospective new employer's immigration attorney prior to accepting an offer. If you don't trust them, consult an attorney independently as well.

## Can I use I-485 portability if the I-140 is still pending?
If you have filed Form I-485 based on an I-140 that was concurrently filed or pending, it's possible that once the I-485 has been pending 180 days, the I-140 is *also* still pending. In that case, you are still eligible for portability.

When you submit Supplement J, if your I-140 is still pending, USCIS will first examine the facts to determine whether or not the I-140 *would have been approvable* if it had been adjudicated at the 180 day mark. If so, the I-140 will be approved, and then USCIS will adjudicate Supplement J. If the I-140 is denied, then portability cannot be granted. [38][39]

Porting with a pending I-140 is considered risky. Even if you believe that the I-140 should be approved, it's possible that USCIS will issue an RFE on the I-140, as the law firm acting on behalf of the I-140 employer may have made a mistake such as forgetting to submit some required document. (There are also allegations that USCIS sometimes asks for documents that shouldn't actually be required.) In that case, it's the I-140 employer's responsibility to provide the missing evidence in order to respond to the RFE, and they may not be interested in doing so for a former employee. If the RFE is not adequately addressed, the I-140 will be denied, and the applicant would have to start over with a new I-140.

## Can I use I-485 portability if the I-140 was withdrawn?
If an I-140 that has already been approved is withdrawn within 180 days of approval, it is revoked [20], which means that the I-485 applicant is not eligible for portability [40] and the I-485 will be denied.

As an exception, if the withdrawal of the already approved I-140 occurs when the I-485 has been pending for 180 days or more, then the applicant retains eligibility for portability [20]. In other words, once the applicant becomes eligible to port at the 180 day mark, the applicant will retain said eligibility even if the I-140 is withdrawn.

If the I-140 has been approved for 180 days or more, then even after it is withdrawn, it remains approved, so eligibility for I-485 portability would continue to exist in that case [17][20].

For example, if Form I-140 is approved on Jun 15, 2019, Form I-485 is filed based on the approved I-140 on Oct 1, 2019, and on Jan 2, 2020, Form I-140 is withdrawn and the employee is fired, then, since the withdrawal occurred more than 180 days after approval, the Form I-140 can still be used for porting. However, the employee would not be able to request portability immediately on Jan 2, 2020, since Form I-485 was filed less than 180 days before that date.

(to be continued)

## How long do I have to stay at my sponsoring employer after my green card is approved?
An employment-based green card, or admission on an employment-based immigrant visa, is granted on the basis of future employment. In all cases, the alien must have the intent to engage in the qualifying employment *after* lawful permanent resident status is granted [26][33]. 

In the case of EB-1B, EB-1C, EB-2 (except NIW), and EB-3 immigrants, the regulations [33] state that:

> In all cases, the applicant and his or her intended employer must demonstrate the intention for the applicant to be employed under the continuing or new employment offer (including self-employment) described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, as applicable, within a reasonable period upon the applicant's grant of lawful permanent resident status. 

Many lawyers recommend staying at the sponsoring employer for 6 months after the green card is approved (or 6 months after admission using an immigrant visa, as the case may be). Some lawyers recommend a year. [35] There is no specific amount of time specified in the regulations. However, some individuals have reported that staying for less than 6 months caused them to be questioned about their actions when they eventually applied for naturalization.

For example, in 2019, a user on Blind posted that 7 years ago, they had left their company after 3 months, and when they applied for citizenship, they were questioned about it by an immigration officer. The immigration officer was satisfied once he saw a letter the applicant provided stating that the job they switched to was for the same manager and the same responsibilities as the job offer their green card was based on. [36]

Some observers believe that the passage of AC21 and its I-485 portability provision abrogated the requirement to stay with the sponsoring employer after I-485 approval. Their argument is that since one is allowed to switch employers 6 months after Form I-485 has been filed, and this does not cause the I-485 to be denied, it ought to be the case that switching after Form I-485 has already been *approved* should, likewise, not invalidate the approval of the I-485. However, this argument is contradicted by the clear wording of the regulations [33] (previously quoted). Paragraph (a)(3) states that the intent to be employed "within a reasonable period upon the applicant's grant of lawful permanent resident status" must exist with respect to either the original job offer on which the adjustment of status was based, or the new employment offer used for porting the I-485. That is, whichever job you have at the time of approval&mdash;whether it was the job offer in the I-140, or a new job offer that was used for porting&mdash;that is the one you must have the intent to remain at "within a reasonable period".

Note that paragraph (a) also states:

> An alien who has a pending application to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident based on an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition filed under section 204(a)(1)(F) of the Act on the applicant's behalf must have a valid offer of employment based on a valid petition at the time the application to adjust status is filed and at the time the alien's application to adjust status is adjudicated, and the applicant must intend to accept such offer of employment.

Here, again, we see that the requirement to have a valid offer of employment, which the applicant intends to accept, applies both at the time of the I-485 filing and at the time of approval. In conclusion: despite the AC21 portability provisions, it remains true that the I-485 applicant, who was approved on the basis of a particular job offer, must be employed in that job for some time after approval.

EB-1A and EB-2 NIW immigrants, if applying for adjustment of status, must sign a statement affirming that they intend to work in the occupational field of extraordinary or exceptional ability, respectively [34]. Again, there is no specific length of time required, but one could imagine that switching one's career to a totally different occupational field within 6 months would raise some red flags.
