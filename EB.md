## What is the typical application process for employment-sponsored immigration?
Most employment-based immigrants will need to be sponsored by an employer and go through the following steps:

1. Labor certification, in which the employer must establish, and the Department of Labor must agree, that they need to fill a position in the United States and cannot fill it by hiring a U.S. worker [1][2][3][4]. Large tech companies such as Google usually have well-established procedures to maximize the chances of approval of the labor certification for software engineers and other technical employees. However, getting a labor certification approved can be a (sometimes insurmountable) challenge for smaller employers and for employers seeking to sponsor employees for non-STEM roles. The acronym *PERM*, referring to the electronic system for labor certification, is often used as a metonym for the labor certification process.
2. Filing and approval of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker by the sponsoring employer [5].
3. Filing and approval of Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status [6].

Your *priority date* is the date on which the labor certification application was accepted for processing by the Department of Labor [7]. This priority date represents your place in line; other employment-based immigration applicants who filed before you will be eligible to receive an immigrant visa or adjustment of status from the annually limited pool before you. You can apply for adjustment of status once the cut-off date published by the State Department becomes later than your priority date [8]. If, upon labor certification approval, the cut-off date is later than your priority date, then you can file Forms I-140 and I-485 concurrently. Otherwise, your employer or authorized representative will file Form I-140 first, the approval of which "locks in" your priority date, and you will have to wait for your priority date to become current before you can file Form I-485.

## I don't think I have any skills that US-based workers don't have. Can my labor certification be approved?
You may be more unique than you believe, and your employer, working together with a good immigration law firm, will try to make that case. Your employer might be sponsoring you for a role that requires experience in specific areas, say, MapReduce together with C++ API design. If you're an experienced software engineer, you probably have many skills that allow you to contribute to the company in a specific and valuable capacity. Even if you're a new grad, you might have done internships or taken specific courses where you learned such specific skills. If not, then in a couple of years, you might have acquired such skills through your full-time experience, and at that point you may be able to start the labor certification process.

It does tend to be more difficult to hire foreign nationals on a permanent basis for non-STEM jobs, unfortunately. Many employers won't even try.

## How long does the labor certification process take?
Between a few months and a year. When immigration lawyers tell you that it's difficult to predict how long this takes, they're not just hedging their words. It's actually quite unpredictable, since it involves three steps, each of which takes an uncertain amount of time:
1. Prevailing wage determination by the Department of Labor, in which the DOL determines how much compensation the employer must offer to U.S. workers in order to entice them to apply for the job;
2. Recruitment, in which your sponsoring employer attempts to recruit a U.S. worker for the position at the prevailing wage, and documents their failure to do so;
3. The application for the labor certification itself, submitted to DOL, which takes time to process, and which may or may not be audited by DOL (meaning that they don't believe the company and will watch them closely as they again attempt to recruit U.S. workers for the position), adding a few more months.

You are also responsible for obtaining letters signed by your former employers' HR departments, your former managers, or other individuals who can attest that you gained the experience required for the role in question while working with them. This can occasionally be difficult. If you can't obtain these letters or if it takes a long time to do so, the labor certification process can be delayed.

## How long does the I-140 take?
This question is usually easy to answer; USCIS provides a [website](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/) where you can look up how backlogged they are. For example, if it tells you that they're currently processing I-140s filed 5 months ago, then you can estimate that your I-140 will take about 5 months to get approved. Unfortunately, that website appears to be broken at the time of writing this answer. Hopefully they'll fix it soon.

It's possible to expedite the I-140 by paying a $1225 [premium processing](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/how-do-i-use-premium-processing-service) fee. If USCIS accepts the fee, they will either render a decision within 15 calendar days or refund the fee. Unfortunately, sometimes they will simply flat-out reject the fee, saying that premium processing isn't available at the moment.

If your employer doesn't pay the premium processing fee for you, they may give you the option of paying it yourself. In cases where you will have to wait many years before filing the I-485, getting premium processing for the I-140 doesn't speed this up, because your priority date is determined by when the labor certification application was filed, not by when the I-140 gets approved. Nevertheless, Brian highly recommends getting premium processing, because the sooner your I-140 is approved, the sooner you can rest assured that your priority date has been locked in. Then, even if you are fired or laid off, or you quit, the priority date will be retained for future immigration applications by another employer (see below for more information).
