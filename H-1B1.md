## What's the difference between H-1B and H-1B1?
The H-1B1 visa is similar to the [H-1B](H-1B.md) visa: it is a nonimmigrant visa that allows an alien to perform skilled labor temporarily for an employer in the United States. However, there are several differences, of which the most important are summarized below:

* H-1B1 status is only available to citizens of Chile and Singapore.
* H-1B1 quotas have never been reached.
* Petitions are not required in order to obtain an H-1B1 visa.
* H-1B1 status is granted in 1-year increments, whereas H-1B status is granted in 3-year increments.
* There is no explicit 6-year limit on the number of times H-1B1 status can be extended.
* H-1B1 workers cannot avail themselves of INA 214(n) portability.
* H-1B1 status does not explicitly allow dual intent.

References for the above claims are provided with the more detailed answers further down this page.

## Who qualifies for an H-1B1 visa?
H-1B1 status is only available to nationals of Chile and Singapore, pursuant to free trade agreements that those countries have signed with the United States [1][2][3]. Like H-1B status, H-1B1 status is only available to an alien in a specialty occupation who is being sponsored by an employer that has filed a labor condition application with the Department of Labor [1]. The definition of "specialty occupation" for H-1B1 status [4] is very slightly different from the definition for H-1B status.

As is the case with H-1B status, the "specialty occupation" criterion for H-1B1 status is subjective and it is not possible for a layman to understand the nuances of the interpretation of the statute, but an employer that frequently sponsors employees for H-1B visas for a particular role will almost certainly be able to sponsor H-1B1 visas as well, provided that their lawyers are familiar with the H-1B1 classification. As is the case with H-1B status, H-1B1 status is generally available to software engineers (for the time being) despite the fact that many software engineers do not have a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related speciality.

I don't know whether increased scrutiny on H-1B applications has also affected H-1B1 applications. If you have information about this, feel free to contribute.

## Why should I apply for an H-1B1 visa as opposed to H-1B or some other work visa?
For those who qualify—only Chileans and Singaporeans—the H-1B1 visa is often the most convenient choice because of the fact that its annual quota has never been reached; while there is a lottery for H-1B visas every year, there is no H-1B1 lottery. Like the H-1B visa, the H-1B1 visa [can be preferable](H-1B.md#why-should-i-apply-for-h-1b-as-opposed-to-other-work-visas) to the [L-1](L-1.md) visa because it doesn't require working for an employer outside the US for 1 year, and to the [O-1](O-1.md) visa because it is much easier to qualify for.

## What is the process to apply for an H-1B1 visa or status?
Due to the terms of the free trade agreements, a petition is not required in order to obtain an H-1B1 visa [5]. However, note that the treaties did *not* grant exemptions from the requirement to obtain a [visa](visas.md) to enter the US. Thus, an alien outside the US, whose employer has filed a labor certification application with the Department of Labor, would apply for an H-1B1 visa at a consular post, submitting documents directly to the consular post rather than to USCIS [6].

An alien already in the United States wishing to change status to H-1B1, however, must have Form I-129 filed on their behalf by their sponsoring employer [7]. The adjudication of Form I-129 is a two-step process, in which USCIS first determines whether the petition is approvable, then determines whether the beneficiary qualifies for the change of status sought [8]. Usually, both steps will be approved, in which case USCIS sends Form I-797A, containing an I-94 indicating the new H-1B status and authorized period of stay [9]. However, it's possible that the petition is approved while the change of status is denied—typically because USCIS has determined that the beneficiary has violated their status, making them ineligible for a change of status—and the beneficiary must usually leave the United States and apply for a visa.

It should be noted that H-1B1 petitions are not eligible for premium processing [12], so leaving the US to apply for an H-1B1 visa will probably be a faster method of obtaining H-1B1 status than changing status to H-1B1 within the US (which requires the petition).

## How long does H-1B1 status last?
Unlike H-1B status, H-1B1 status may only be granted for 1 year at a time, and can be extended in 1-year increments [10]. Extensions of H-1B1 status are done using Form I-129 [7]. However, there is no statutory or regulatory limit on the number of extensions that can be granted. Therefore, H-1B1 workers who have already worked in the US for 6 years in H-1B1 status can continue to extend their status.

However, H-1B1 status does not allow [dual intent](general.md#what-is-dual-intent), so aliens who work in the US in H-1B1 status for many years could eventually be denied further extensions on the grounds that they seem to be an intending immigrant. For this reason, H-1B1 workers often switch to H-1B status and apply for a green card, or, in some cases, start the green card process while still in H-1B1 status. (We'll discuss the issue of dual intent further below.)

## What happens if my employer applies to extend my stay, but my I-94 expires while the petition is pending?
When remaining at the same employer, as long as they file the extension petition before the expiration of your H-1B1 work authorization, you are authorized to continue working at the same employer for **up to 240 days after your I-94 expires** (unless the extension petition is denied) [15]. Thus, as long as USCIS continues to adjudicate petitions within 240 days, there should generally be no reason for your H-1B1 employment to be interrupted, as long as the employer always files for an extension **before your I-94 expires**.

(Note however that the situation is different when *switching* employers. The filing of a petition by a new employer does not grant authorization to remain past your I-94 expiration. See the question below regarding switching employers.)

Since the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual explicitly states that unlawful presence does not accrue while a timely, nonfrivolous petition for extension of stay is pending [16], USCIS will not consider you to have accrued unlawful presence by overstaying your I-94 when you qualify for the 240-day rule. However, USCIS policy is not binding on CBP and the State Department. Furthermore, once your status expires as indicated on your I-94, you are no longer considered to be maintaining your nonimmigrant status, so by the letter of the law, you are technically removable even though another provision of the law says that you are authorized to be employed in the United States. Although this is a mess, the long-standing practice of the US government is that you do not accrue unlawful presence and you are not subject to deportation as a result of your I-94 expiring while you qualify for the 240-day rule. Any change to this practice would almost certainly be challenged in the courts for being inconsistent with the intent of the federal regulations.

If the extension petition is denied after your I-94 has expired, your employment authorization will terminate, and unlawful presence will begin to accrue [17].

## Can I do any work other than for my sponsoring employer?
An H-1B1 worker who does not have an EAD is only permitted to work for their sponsoring employer [11]. It is permitted to work for multiple employers concurrently, but only as long as each employer wishing to employ the H-1B1 alien has met the applicable requirements. In other words, an H-1B1 alien in the United States who wants to begin new concurrent employment must wait until the new employer has had Form I-129 approved (and the new employer must have filed a labor condition application); while the Foreign Affairs Manual is not clear on this, it appears that an alien outside the United States, who already has an H-1B1 visa authorizing employment with one employer, who wishes to work for both that employer and a new employer concurrently upon their return to the US, must apply for a new H-1B1 visa, presenting required evidence concerning the new employment to a consular post, and explaining that they intend to work for both employers. See for example [here](https://immigrationworkvisa.com/h1b1-visa/).

## Can I be self-employed while in H-1B1 status?
According to the U.S. embassy in [Chile](https://cl.usembassy.gov/visas/nonimmigrant-visas/), H-1B1 workers cannot be self-employed or independent contractors. See the [answer](H-1B.md#can-i-be-self-employed-while-in-h-1b-status) to the similar question about H-1B status. Although the regulations are not crystal clear, it seems reasonable to assume that the nuances of the H-1B employer-employee relationship requirement also apply to H-1B1 status. However, note again that if you have an EAD, you can work for any employer, including being self-employed.

## How can I get an Employment Authorization Document (EAD)?
The answer to this question is the same as for [H-1B](H-1B.md#how-can-i-get-an-employment-authorization-document-ead) workers.

## How can I change employers in H-1B1 status?
Since, as discussed above, H-1B1 nonimmigrants are generally authorized only to work for a sponsoring employer, if an H-1B worker wants to change jobs, the new company must be one that is willing to sponsor H-1B1s. If you want to switch employers while in the US, the new employer must file a petition on Form I-129. If you intend to leave the US and then return to work for the new employer, while the Foreign Affairs Manual does not specifically cover this situation, some online resources (*e.g.*, [here](https://immigrationworkvisa.com/h1b1-visa/) and [here](https://visaguide.world/us-visa/nonimmigrant/employment/h1b/h1b1/)) indicate that it is necessary to apply for a new H-1B1 visa for the new employer, and the original H-1B1 visa will be cancelled if you no longer intend to work for the old employer.

One important difference between H-1B and H-1B1 status is that an H-1B1 worker may **not** start working at the new employer while the new petition is pending. They must wait for the petition to be approved. This is because the text of INA 214(n) [13] specifically refers to the paragraph of the Immigration and Nationality Act that defines H-1B status, whereas H-1B1 status is defined in the following paragraph. The fact that H-1B1 workers do not benefit from INA 214(n) portability is also noted in the federal regulations [14]. Unfortunately, immigration lawyers providing answers on the internet often seem to believe, mistakenly, that INA 214(n) portability applies to H-1B1 workers. Thus, the options are to have the new employer file an H-1B1 petition and wait for it to be *approved* before switching to the new employer, or to leave the US and apply for a new H-1B1 visa.

Since premium processing is not available for H-1B1 petitions [12], leaving the US and applying for a new H-1B1 visa for the new employer is likely to be faster than switching employers while in the US. (However, the new employer's filing of the petition does not terminate your work authorization at your old employer, so going the I-129 route does not require being temporarily unemployed; you can hand in your resignation after the new petition is approved.)
