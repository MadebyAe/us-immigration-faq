## Why should I apply for H-1B as opposed to other work visas?
Most people who want to work in the United States will only be able to qualify for either H-1B or [L-1](L-1.md) status, although you can find a list of other work visas on the [general FAQ](general.md). Foreign nationals who already live in the US are usually more interested in H-1B status, since obtaining L-1 status would require them to spend a year working outside the US first. In addition, since L-1 status is only valid with respect to the particular company the alien has worked at for a year abroad, it's not possible to switch companies while in L-1 status without leaving the US or switching to H-1B [1]. Even people who already hold L-1 status will often need to switch to H-1B in order to be able to continue working in the US for longer than five years (see below).

## Who can qualify for H-1B status?
You may be eligible for H-1B status if an employer sponsors you for a position in a "specialty occupation", which is an occupation that generally requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent training or progressive experience. See [this page by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-dod-cooperative-research-and-development-project-workers-and-fashion-models) for more information.

You may have noticed that this is a subjective criterion. Since many software engineers don't have a bachelor's degree, does software engineering qualify as a specialty occupation? For now, most software engineers are eligible for H-1B status, although there has been a recent uptick in RFEs (Requests for Evidence) issued by USCIS, alleging that the position for which the foreign worker is sought is not a specialty occupation.

USCIS does not release data on H-1B petition rejections broken down by occupation, so for now, the only way to get a sense of how good your chances are is to simply try to find out whether companies are sponsoring H-1B workers in your occupation. (In general, employers won't attempt to sponsor H-1B workers unless their experience is that there is a good chance of success; it is easier to hire U.S. workers instead.) However, because of the subjectivity of the criteria, the US government may change its opinion in the future about which occupations are specialty occupations.

## Which companies are sponsoring H-1B workers?
The Department of Labor publishes an annual report that includes, among other information, a list of employers that receive the greatest number of nonimmigrant labor certifications. The top 10 from [the 2016 report](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/OFLC_Annual_Report_FY2016.pdf) are reproduced below:

1. Cognizant
2. Microsoft
3. Intel
4. Google
5. Amazon
6. Infosys
7. Apple
8. Cisco
9. Wipro
10. Oracle

## Why do you have to win a lottery in order to get an H-1B?
By statute, only a limited number of people can be granted H-1B status for the first time during each fiscal year (starting on Oct 1). Namely, there is a quota of 65,000 [2] plus an additional quota of 20,000 that only people with a master's degree from a US institution can qualify for [11], making a total of 85,000 per year. (There are some exceptions to the quota; see below.)

In recent years there have been more than 85,000 applicants per year. You might think that this would lead to long queues. However, under current regulations, an employer can file a petition for an H-1B worker *at most* 6 months before they need the worker to start work [9]. This means that in order to gain access to a visa under the quota for the new fiscal year beginning on Oct 1, the employer can only file starting on Apr 1. Therefore, all the employers who want to hire H-1Bs in that year have to file in the first week of April, otherwise the entire quota will be exhausted by other applications that were filed earlier! As a result, come the first week of April each year, USCIS is inundated with over 100,000 H-1B petitions [3–8]. Regulations provide that when this situation occurs, USCIS must randomly reject some of the petitions [10]. If a petition on your behalf is selected during this random selection process, you are said to have "won the lottery" (although it's still possible that USCIS will reject the petition on merits). Otherwise, you lose the lottery, and will have to wait until next April to try again.

## Who is not subject to the H-1B cap?
* Aliens "employed at an institution of higher education... or a related or affiliated nonprofit entity" are not subject to numerical limitation [12]. Therefore, university faculty generally don't have any trouble getting H-1B visas. Similarly, aliens "employed at a nonprofit research organization or a governmental research organization" are exempt from the cap.
* Aliens who have already been counted against the cap are, for the next 6 years, not subject to the cap when seeking admission in H-1B status or switching to another employer wishing to sponsor them for H-1B status [13]. Days spent outside the US do not count against the 6 years [14], so winning the lottery qualifies you up to 6 years of total time in the US in H-1B status, assuming that you also qualify on the merits and are not inadmissible.
* There are circumstances in which H-1B time can be extended beyond 6 years (see below).

## What are the rules on recapturing the unused portion of your 6 years?
As discussed previously, once you are counted against the cap, you are entitled to not be counted against the cap again until you've used up your total 6 years, and days spent outside the US do not count toward that limit [14]. Days spent outside the US are said to be eligible for "recapture": that is, a petition for extension of H-1B status can request an extension beyond the 6th anniversary of the alien's initial admission in H-1B status by demonstrating that the alien was outside the US for some of the 6 year period. According to regulations [14]:

> It is the H-1B petitioner's burden to request and demonstrate the specific amount of time for recapture on behalf of the beneficiary. The beneficiary may provide appropriate evidence, such as copies of passport stamps, Arrival-Departure Records (Form I-94), or airline tickets, together with a chart, indicating the dates spent outside of the United States, and referencing the relevant independent documentary evidence, when seeking to recapture the alien's time spent outside the United States. Based on the evidence provided, USCIS may grant all, part, or none of the recapture period requested. 

Some immigration lawyers appear to believe that the opportunity to request recapture expires on the 6th anniversary. However, this is contradicted by the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual, which gives the following example [15]:

> an alien who spent five years in the United States in H-1B status (from January 1, 1999 - December 31, 2004), and then remained outside the United States for all of 2005, could seek to be admitted in January 2006 for the “remainder” of the initial six-year period, i.e., a total of one year."

## What are the chances of winning the H-1B lottery?
In the random selection process, cap-subject petitions for an alien with a master's degree are first entered into the lottery for the 20,000 visas available under the master's degree exemption. Petitions not selected in the master's lottery are then entered in the general lottery for 65,000 visas together with all the remaining cap-subject petitions [5–8][9]. Therefore, we can calculate the chances of winning the lottery in previous years based on data provided by USCIS (TODO)

## I've heard people try to game the system by having multiple companies submit H-1B petitions for them.
