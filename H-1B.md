## Why should I apply for H-1B as opposed to other work visas?
Most people who want to work in the United States will only be able to qualify for either H-1B or [L-1](L-1.md) status, although you can find a list of other work visas on the [general FAQ](general.md). Foreign nationals who already live in the US are usually more interested in H-1B status, since obtaining L-1 status would require them to spend a year working outside the US first. In addition, since L-1 status is only valid with respect to the particular company the alien has worked at for a year abroad, it's not possible to switch companies while in L-1 status without leaving the US or switching to H-1B [1]. Even people who already hold L-1 status will often need to switch to H-1B in order to be able to continue working in the US for longer than five years (see below).

## What is the process to apply for an H-1B visa or H-1B status?
H-1B is a petition-based classification; an H-1B visa or change of status to H-1B cannot be granted unless the employer has filed an appropriate petition [28]. The form that the employer must use for filing a petition is called Form I-129 [29]. You don't have to worry about this form too much, since it will always be prepared by your employer or by a lawyer on your employer's behalf. However, we will make occasional references to it. If the petition is approved, the employer will receive a Form I-797 [30] and will usually forward the original to the prospective H-1B worker, keeping a copy for themselves.

If the beneficiary (*i.e.,* the alien seeking to be employed in H-1B status) is abroad, they are usually required to apply for a [visa](visas.md). Visa-exempt individuals, such as Canadians, must bring the original I-797 or a copy to the port of entry when applying for admission [31]. If the beneficiary is already in the United States, the petitioner may request to change the beneficiary's status to H-1B instead of requiring them to leave the US and apply for an H-1B visa [32]. The adjudication of such a request is a two-step process, in which USCIS first determines whether the beneficiary qualifies for H-1B classification, and then determines whether the beneficiary qualifies to change their status to H-1B while in the United States [33]. Usually, both steps will be approved, in which case USCIS sends Form I-797A, containing an I-94 indicating the new H-1B status and authorized period of stay [34]. However, it's possible that the petition is approved while the change of status is denied—typically because USCIS has determined that the beneficiary has violated their status, making them ineligible for a change of status—and the beneficiary must usually leave the United States and apply for a visa or for status at the port of entry.

## Who can qualify for H-1B status?
You may be eligible for H-1B status if an employer sponsors you for a position in a "specialty occupation", which is an occupation that generally requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent training or progressive experience. See [this page by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-dod-cooperative-research-and-development-project-workers-and-fashion-models) for more information.

You may have noticed that this is a subjective criterion. Since many software engineers don't have a bachelor's degree, does software engineering qualify as a specialty occupation? For now, most software engineers are eligible for H-1B status, although there has been a recent uptick in RFEs (Requests for Evidence) issued by USCIS, alleging that the position for which the foreign worker is sought is not a specialty occupation.

USCIS does not release data on H-1B petition rejections broken down by occupation, so for now, the only way to get a sense of how good your chances are is to simply try to find out whether companies are sponsoring H-1B workers in your occupation. (In general, employers won't attempt to sponsor H-1B workers unless their experience is that there is a good chance of success; it is easier to hire U.S. workers instead.) However, because of the subjectivity of the criteria, the US government may change its opinion in the future about which occupations are specialty occupations.

## Which companies are sponsoring H-1B workers?
The Department of Labor publishes an annual report that includes, among other information, a list of employers that receive the greatest number of nonimmigrant labor certifications. The top 10 from [the 2016 report](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/OFLC_Annual_Report_FY2016.pdf) are reproduced below:

1. Cognizant
2. Microsoft
3. Intel
4. Google
5. Amazon
6. Infosys
7. Apple
8. Cisco
9. Wipro
10. Oracle

## Why do you have to win a lottery in order to get an H-1B?
By statute, only a limited number of people can be granted H-1B status for the first time during each fiscal year (starting on Oct 1). Namely, there is a quota of 65,000 [2] plus an additional quota of 20,000 that only people with a master's degree from a US institution can qualify for [11], making a total of 85,000 per year. (There are some exceptions to the quota; see below.)

In recent years there have been more than 85,000 applicants per year. You might think that this would lead to long queues. However, under current regulations, an employer can file a petition for an H-1B worker *at most* 6 months before they need the worker to start work [9]. This means that in order to gain access to a visa under the quota for the new fiscal year beginning on Oct 1, the employer can only file starting on Apr 1. Therefore, all the employers who want to hire H-1Bs in that year have to file in the first week of April, otherwise the entire quota will be exhausted by other applications that were filed earlier! As a result, come the first week of April each year, USCIS is inundated with over 100,000 H-1B petitions [3–8]. Regulations provide that when this situation occurs, USCIS must randomly reject some of the petitions [10]. If a petition on your behalf is selected during this random selection process, you are said to have "won the lottery" (although it's still possible that USCIS will reject the petition on merits). Otherwise, you lose the lottery, and will have to wait until next April to try again.

## Who is not subject to the H-1B cap?
* Aliens "employed at an institution of higher education... or a related or affiliated nonprofit entity" are not subject to numerical limitation [12]. Therefore, university faculty generally don't have any trouble getting H-1B visas. Similarly, aliens "employed at a nonprofit research organization or a governmental research organization" are exempt from the cap.
* Aliens who have already been counted against the cap are, for the next 6 years, not subject to the cap when seeking admission in H-1B status or switching to another employer wishing to sponsor them for H-1B status [13]. Days spent outside the US do not count against the 6 years [14], so winning the lottery qualifies you up to 6 years of total time in the US in H-1B status, assuming that you also qualify on the merits and are not inadmissible.
* There are circumstances in which H-1B time can be extended beyond 6 years (see below).

## What happens when you have used up 6 years in H-1B status?
We simply quote the text of the relevant regulation [41]:

> An H-1B alien in a specialty occupation or an alien of distinguished merit and ability who has spent six years in the United States under section 101(a)(15)(H) and/or (L) of the Act may not seek extension, change status, or be readmitted to the United States under section 101(a)(15) (H) or (L) of the Act unless the alien has resided and been physically present outside the United States, except for brief trips for business or pleasure, for the immediate prior year.

There are some exceptions to the 6-year limitation in cases where the alien is being [sponsored for a green card](EB.md), which are discussed in more detail below.

Once the alien has resided outside the US for one year, they can qualify for H-1B status again, but are no longer cap-exempt as described in [13] and must go through the lottery again in order to obtain a new allotment of up to 6 years in H-1B status.

## What are the rules on recapturing the unused portion of your 6 years?
As discussed previously, once you are counted against the cap, you are entitled to not be counted against the cap again until you've used up your total 6 years, and days spent outside the US do not count toward that limit [14]. Days spent outside the US are said to be eligible for "recapture": that is, a petition for extension of H-1B status can request an extension beyond the 6th anniversary of the alien's initial admission in H-1B status by demonstrating that the alien was outside the US for some of the 6 year period. According to regulations [14]:

> It is the H-1B petitioner's burden to request and demonstrate the specific amount of time for recapture on behalf of the beneficiary. The beneficiary may provide appropriate evidence, such as copies of passport stamps, Arrival-Departure Records (Form I-94), or airline tickets, together with a chart, indicating the dates spent outside of the United States, and referencing the relevant independent documentary evidence, when seeking to recapture the alien's time spent outside the United States. Based on the evidence provided, USCIS may grant all, part, or none of the recapture period requested. 

Some immigration lawyers appear to believe that the opportunity to request recapture expires on the 6th anniversary. However, this is contradicted by the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual, which gives the following example [15]:

> an alien who spent five years in the United States in H-1B status (from January 1, 1999 - December 31, 2004), and then remained outside the United States for all of 2005, could seek to be admitted in January 2006 for the “remainder” of the initial six-year period, i.e., a total of one year."

## What are the chances of winning the H-1B lottery?
In the random selection process, cap-subject petitions for an alien with a master's degree are first entered into the lottery for the 20,000 visas available under the master's degree exemption. Petitions not selected in the master's lottery are then entered in the general lottery for 65,000 visas together with all the remaining cap-subject petitions [5–8][9]. Therefore, we can estimate the chances of winning the lottery in previous years based on data provided by USCIS. Unfortunately, this is not as straightforward as it looks, because while USCIS has published the number of cap-subject petitions received in recent years [3–8], they don't say how many of them are for beneficiaries with a US master's or higher. Based on data available in [16], let us make the very crude estimate that the fraction of cap-subject petitions filed in FY N that qualified for the master's cap equals the fraction of approved petitions for initial employment in FY N-1 that were for beneficiaries with a master's degree or higher. (Note that petitions *for* the beginning of FY N are filed *in* April of FY N-1.) We therefore get the following estimates:

| Fiscal year | Number of cap-subject petitions filed | Estimated number of petitions filed under master's cap | Chance of winning lottery with US master's or higher | Chance of winning lottery without US master's |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2014 | 124,000 | 64,800 | 74% | 62% |
| 2015 | 172,500 | 93,100 | 55% | 43% |
| 2016 | 233,000 | 131,400 | 41% | 31% |
| 2017 | 236,000 | 142,000 | 40% | 30% |
| 2018 | 199,000 | 112,300 | 48% | 36% |
| 2019 | 190,098 | ? | ? | ? |

Note that these figures are inaccurate not only due to the approximation discussed above, but also because not all petitions selected in the lottery are approved (the existence of someone else's petition that is denied on its merits, in theory, doesn't reduce your chances of winning the lottery, since it doesn't consume any quota), because an alien with multiple petitions approved is counted only once, and because there are special rules for Chile and Singapore (see below). So, you really should take the numbers in the chart above as very crude approximations.

It's not clear why the number of petitions filed dropped between FY 2017 and FY 2018, although some reasonable hypotheses are:
* The low probability of winning the lottery discouraged employers from filing cap-subject petitions for new candidates for employment.
* The outcome of the 2016 presidential election discouraged both employers and candidates from trying for a visa that might come under tighter scrutiny. (Note that cap-subject petitions for FY 2017 were filed in April 2016, *before* the election, so the timing makes sense.)
* The outcome of the 2016 presidential election caused some foreigners to change their minds about whether they wanted to live in the US.
* Uncertainty over whether the new administration would stop issuing EADs to spouses of H-1B workers discouraged married and engaged individuals from seeking H-1B visas.

## I've heard people try to increase their chances in the lottery by having multiple companies submit H-1B petitions for them.
Federal regulations state that when the random selection procedure must be used, it is *petitions* that are sampled randomly [10]. USCIS appears to acknowledge the possibility that having multiple petitions in the lottery can be used as a tactic to increase one's chances of winning, which is the reason why they adopted a policy [17] that if one employer submits multiple petitions for the same alien, all such petitions will be denied [19]. This is the case even if the multiple petitions are for different roles [18].

Evidently, USCIS has the ability to detect duplicate petitions (presumably using some subset of the alien's name, country of birth, I-94 number, and passport number), but there appears to be no evidence for the claim that USCIS uses this detection algorithm to collapse all petitions into a single "lottery ticket". Therefore, it appears that you **can**, in fact, increase your chances of winning the lottery by having multiple petitions filed on your behalf, provided that USCIS is convinced they are not duplicative.

However, as discussed above, you need multiple *different* employers to file H-1B petitions for you in April, otherwise your chances will drop to zero. Furthermore, if USCIS finds that "related entities" do not have a "legitimate business need" to file petitions on behalf of the same alien, they will likewise deny all such petitions [18][19]. In the case *Matter of S- Inc.*, the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office determined that even if two companies do not have any legal relationship with each other, they can still be considered "related entities" if they appear to be "acting in concert" to file multiple petitions for the same alien "for the same full-time position with the same end client through the same vendors during the same time frame" [20].

Thus, in order to use this tactic, you need to get two *genuinely distinct* offers. For example, if you are graduating soon, and you have applied to both Google, Inc. and Facebook, Inc. as a new grad software engineer, both have extended you an offer and both are willing to sponsor you for a work visa and enter you in the H-1B lottery, and you accept both offers and fill out the required paperwork, then you'd double your chances of having at least one petition approved, compared to someone else who only has one petition filed on their behalf. (This tactic does not appear to be used often, possibly because candidates don't like to be dishonest by accepting multiple offers and risk burning bridges.)

## Can I do any work other than for my sponsoring employer?
Unless they have an EAD, an H-1B alien is only permitted to work for a petitioning employer [21], but can work for multiple petitioning employers concurrently [22]. Thus, when an H-1B worker wants to work for an employer other than the employer that sponsored their current status, the new employer must file an H-1B petition, and the employee may choose to work for both employers concurrently, or to quit their current job and start working for the new employer.

## Can I be self-employed while in H-1B status?
Due to [8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(ii)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/214.2#h_4_ii), a petitioning employer must have an "employer-employee relationship" with the beneficiary, and USCIS has interpreted this requirement to include the "right to control". If you're self-employed, then there's no entity other than yourself that has the right to control your work, so this requirement would not be satisfied [23]. Since, as discussed in the previous answer, an H-1B worker isn't permitted to engage in any employment other than for a petitioning employer [21], this effectively prohibits self-employment while in H-1B status (again, unless you have an EAD; see below).

This does **not** mean that H-1B workers aren't permitted to start companies, but if they want to be able to work for their startup while in H-1B status, there must be a legal structure in which an employer-employee relationship exists according to USCIS policy. For example, if you co-found a startup with a US citizen, in which the US citizen is the CEO and you are the CTO, and you report directly to the CEO, with the CEO having the power to fire you, then this startup *may* be able to sponsor you for H-1B status. It should go without saying that if you're planning on getting your work authorization through your startup, you should consult an immigration lawyer who is experienced with drafting H-1B petitions for startups, and have them advise you on what kind of legal structure would allow you to achieve your objectives.

## How can I get an Employment Authorization Document (EAD)?
An EAD grants employment authorization that is not restricted to a particular employer (for example, it allows self-employment), but not all H-1B nonimmigrants will qualify for one. There are two common ways for an H-1B nonimmigrant to get an EAD:
1. With a pending Form I-485 [24]. Usually this will be at the final stage of the [employment-based green card process](EB.md), but could also occur through, *e.g.*, marriage to a US citizen. See [the green card FAQ](green-card.md).
2. With an approved [Form I-140](EB.md), but only if you can convince USCIS that you have "compelling circumstances" and your priority date is within 1 year of the cut-off date [25][26].

## How can I change employers in H-1B status?
Since, as discussed above, H-1B nonimmigrants are generally authorized only to work for a sponsoring employer, if an H-1B worker wants to change jobs, the new company must be one that is willing to sponsor H-1Bs, and must file an H-1B petition (Form I-129) on behalf of the prospective employee. Therefore, the new job must also be in a speciality occupation and is subject to the same evidentiary requirements as any previous H-1B petitions. However, as previously discussed, an alien who has already been counted against the H-1B cap does not need to enter the lottery again until they've used up 6 years of H-1B time [13]. This means that switching jobs while already in H-1B status tends to be a quicker process than getting an H-1B for your first job in the US.

If the H-1B worker wants to change employers without leaving the US, the new employer should file for an extension of stay on the I-129 petition [35]. (Note that sometimes this doesn't actually lengthen the period for which the beneficiary is allowed to remain in the US, but it is nonetheless considered an application for extension of stay. Presumably the logic employed by USCIS here is that the alien's authorized period of stay in H-1B status *with respect to the new employer* is initially zero, and then becomes nonzero once the petition is approved.)

In order to make it as easy as possible for H-1B workers to switch jobs, the [AC21 Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Competitiveness_in_the_21st_Century_Act) included a provision that allows an H-1B worker to commence new employment as soon as the new employer *files* the H-1B petition; that is, it's not necessary to wait for the petition to be *approved*. However, in order to take advantage of this portability provision, the H-1B worker must meet the other conditions to be eligible for extension of stay, that is, they must be maintaining their H-1B status at the time of filing, and in particular musut not have engaged in unauthorized employment [27][37][39]. If the petition is denied, the worker must stop working for the new employer [27].

The H-1B worker can continue to use their valid, unexpired H-1B visa for admission to the United States after changing employers. However, if the visa expires while the new petition is pending, they won't be eligible for a new visa until the new petition is approved [40]. Therefore, H-1B workers should not travel outside the United States while a portability petition is pending unless their visa will still be valid at the time they plan to return.

## What happens if my I-94 expires while my new employer's H-1B petition is pending?
According to INA 214(n), "Employment authorization shall continue for such alien until the new petition is adjudicated." Thus, if you were maintaining your H-1B status at the time of filing, and thus qualify for INA 214(n) portability, then the expiration of your previously authorized period of stay during the pendency of the portability petition does not terminate your employment authorization with the new employer. In other words, you can keep working for the new employer, within the period requested on the new I-129, until the new petition is either approved or denied.

Unfortunately, the laws that are actually on the books are unclear about this. Since the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual explicitly states that unlawful presence does not accrue while a timely, nonfrivolous petition for extension of stay is pending [42], USCIS will not consider you to have accrued unlawful presence by overstaying your I-94 when you qualify for INA 214(n) portability. However, USCIS policy is not binding on CBP and the State Department. Furthermore, once your status expires as indicated on your I-94, you are no longer considered to be maintaining your nonimmigrant status, so by the letter of the law, you are technically removable even though another provision of the law says that you are authorized to be employed in the United States. Although this is a mess, the long-standing practice of the US government is that you do not accrue unlawful presence and you are not subject to deportation as a result of your I-94 expiring while your portability petition is pending. Any change to this practice would almost certainly be challenged in the courts for being inconsistent with the intent of Congress in enacting INA 214(n).

If the petition is denied after your I-94 has expired, you no longer have authorization to be employed in the US, and unlawful presence begins to accrue [43].
