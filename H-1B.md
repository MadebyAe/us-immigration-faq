## Who can qualify for H-1B status?
You may be eligible for H-1B status if an employer sponsors you for a position in a "specialty occupation", which is an occupation that generally requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent training or progressive experience. See [this page by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-dod-cooperative-research-and-development-project-workers-and-fashion-models) for more information.

You may have noticed that this is a subjective criterion. Since many software engineers don't have a bachelor's degree, does software engineering qualify as a specialty occupation? For now, most software engineers are eligible for H-1B status, although there has been a recent uptick in RFEs (Requests for Evidence) issued by USCIS, alleging that the position for which the foreign worker is sought is not a specialty occupation.

USCIS does not release data on H-1B petition rejections broken down by occupation, so for now, the only way to get a sense of how good your chances are is to simply try to find out whether companies are sponsoring H-1B workers in your occupation. (In general, employers won't attempt to sponsor H-1B workers unless their experience is that there is a good chance of success; it is easier to hire U.S. workers instead.) However, because of the subjectivity of the criteria, the US government may change its opinion in the future about which occupations are specialty occupations.

## Which companies are sponsoring H-1B workers?
The Department of Labor publishes an annual report that includes, among other information, a list of employers that receive the greatest number of nonimmigrant labor certifications. The top 10 from [the 2016 report](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/OFLC_Annual_Report_FY2016.pdf) are reproduced below:

1. Cognizant
2. Microsoft
3. Intel
4. Google
5. Amazon
6. Infosys
7. Apple
8. Cisco
9. Wipro
