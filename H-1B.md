## Why should I apply for H-1B as opposed to other work visas?
Most people who want to work in the United States will only be able to qualify for either H-1B or [L-1](L-1.md) status, although you can find a list of other work visas on the [general FAQ](general.md). Foreign nationals who already live in the US are usually more interested in H-1B status, since obtaining L-1 status would require them to spend a year working outside the US first. In addition, since L-1 status is only valid with respect to the particular company the alien has worked at for a year abroad, it's not possible to switch companies while in L-1 status without leaving the US or switching to H-1B [1]. Even people who already hold L-1 status will often need to switch to H-1B in order to be able to continue working in the US for longer than five years (see below).

## Who can qualify for H-1B status?
You may be eligible for H-1B status if an employer sponsors you for a position in a "specialty occupation", which is an occupation that generally requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent training or progressive experience. See [this page by USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-dod-cooperative-research-and-development-project-workers-and-fashion-models) for more information.

You may have noticed that this is a subjective criterion. Since many software engineers don't have a bachelor's degree, does software engineering qualify as a specialty occupation? For now, most software engineers are eligible for H-1B status, although there has been a recent uptick in RFEs (Requests for Evidence) issued by USCIS, alleging that the position for which the foreign worker is sought is not a specialty occupation.

USCIS does not release data on H-1B petition rejections broken down by occupation, so for now, the only way to get a sense of how good your chances are is to simply try to find out whether companies are sponsoring H-1B workers in your occupation. (In general, employers won't attempt to sponsor H-1B workers unless their experience is that there is a good chance of success; it is easier to hire U.S. workers instead.) However, because of the subjectivity of the criteria, the US government may change its opinion in the future about which occupations are specialty occupations.

## Which companies are sponsoring H-1B workers?
The Department of Labor publishes an annual report that includes, among other information, a list of employers that receive the greatest number of nonimmigrant labor certifications. The top 10 from [the 2016 report](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/OFLC_Annual_Report_FY2016.pdf) are reproduced below:

1. Cognizant
2. Microsoft
3. Intel
4. Google
5. Amazon
6. Infosys
7. Apple
8. Cisco
9. Wipro
10. Oracle

## Why do you have to win a lottery in order to get an H-1B?
With some exceptions, in each fiscal year (which starts on Oct 1), only up to 65,000 aliens can be granted H-1B status for the first time [2], but in recent years there have been more than 65,000 applicants per year. You might think that this would lead to long queues. However, under current regulations, an employer can file a petition for an H-1B worker *at most* 6 months before they need the worker to start work [9]. This means that in order to gain access to a visa under the quota for the new fiscal year beginning on Oct 1, the employer can only file starting on Apr 1. Therefore, all the employers who want to hire H-1Bs in that year have to file in the first week of April, otherwise the entire quota will be exhausted by other applications that were filed earlier! As a result, come the first week of April each year, USCIS is inundated with over 100,000 H-1B petitions [3–8]. Regulations provide that when this situation occurs, USCIS must randomly reject some of the petitions [10]. If a petition on your behalf is selected during this random selection process, you are said to have "won the lottery" (although it's still possible that USCIS will reject the petition on merits). Otherwise, you lose the lottery, and will have to wait until next April to try again.
